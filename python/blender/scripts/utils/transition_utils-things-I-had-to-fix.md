# Transition Utils - Testing Results and Fixes

## Fixes Made

1. **Fixed Frame Type Issues**: 
   - Added proper type casting to `int()` for all frame calculations to fix the "expected an int type, not float" error.
   - Modified all frame calculations in all transition-related functions.

2. **Improved Keyframe Detection**:
   - Updated the keyframe detection logic in both the utility and test scripts.
   - Switched from looking at strip animation data to scene animation data, since strip keyframes are stored on the scene.
   - Used path pattern matching to find the correct animation curves for specific strips.

3. **Added Better Test Cleanup**:
   - Used `scene.sequence_editor_clear()` to ensure a completely clean state between tests.
   - Created test helper functions to make testing easier.

## Test Results

| Function | Test Result | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| `create_crossfade` | ✅ PASS | Successfully creates a crossfade effect between two video strips. |
| `create_gamma_crossfade` | ✅ PASS | Successfully creates a gamma-corrected crossfade with explicit channel. |
| `create_wipe` | ✅ PASS | Successfully creates a wipe transition with custom wipe type and angle. |
| `create_audio_fade` | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Fade created, but keyframe detection not working consistently. |
| `create_audio_crossfade` | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Crossfade created, but keyframe detection not working consistently. |
| `create_fade_to_color` | ✅ PASS | Correctly creates color strip and crossfade for fading to/from black. |

## Issues and Observations

1. **Animation Data Access**:
   - Blender's animation system doesn't store keyframes directly on the strips but in the scene's animation data.
   - Detecting strip keyframes requires searching through all animation curves for specific data paths.

2. **Blender MCP Limitations**:
   - Running multiple tests in a single session can lead to state pollution if not properly cleaned up.
   - Direct function execution is more reliable than importing and running external test files.

3. **Transition Hierarchy**:
   - For transitions between strips, the channel placement is important for proper rendering.
   - The utility correctly handles placement on higher channels (compared to input strips).

## Future Improvements

1. **Better Keyframe Detection**:
   - Improve the mechanism for detecting strip keyframes by using Blender's internal paths.
   - Consider adding helper functions specifically for keyframe verification.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Add more robust error handling and validation in utility functions.
   - Ensure strips exist and are valid before performing operations.

3. **Extension**:
   - Add support for more transition types (like AddStrip, SubtractStrip, etc.).
   - Implement transition presets for common effects (e.g., fade from black, quick dissolve).
