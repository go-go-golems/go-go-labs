# Work Report: form-generator Improvements (2025-09-15)

## Executive Summary

We extended the `form-generator` CLI beyond simple push operations to support full round-trip workflows and richer discovery tooling. The tool now:

- Replaces items when updating an existing form instead of appending duplicates.
- Exports a form back to Uhoh Wizard DSL YAML and persists submission data via Glazed.
- Annotates generated forms with opaque metadata so DSL identifiers are recoverable.
- Streams form submissions through the Glazed pipeline, exposing formatting/selection flags.
- Lists Google Forms available in Drive with flexible sorting and formatting.

These changes standardise command architecture around Glazed’s `GlazeCommand` interface, share OAuth scaffolding across verbs, and provide better hooks for future automation (diffing, auditing, migration tooling).

## Timeline & Major Tasks

1. **Form update semantics**
   - Changed `CreateOrUpdateForm` to delete existing items before re-creation so updates reflect DSL state exactly.
   - Added post-update refreshes and clearer error reporting.

2. **Metadata retention & DSL round-tripping**
   - Introduced `metadata.go` helper to encode step/field identifiers into `ItemId`/`QuestionId` using base64 payloads.
   - Updated request builder to stamp metadata for form steps, decisions, and page breaks.
   - Extended conversion logic (`convert.go`) to decode metadata first, falling back to slugged titles only when needed.

3. **Fetch verbs**
   - Added `fetch` command that loads a form via Forms API, converts to DSL, and writes YAML or stdout.
   - Implemented `fetch-submissions` as a Glazed command with optional debug logging and metadata mapping.
   - Reworked submission output to emit one row per answer with responder metadata, choice arrays, and file uploads.
   - Layer configuration uses `WithLayersList` to compose OAuth/Glazed parameter layers without manual merging.

4. **Drive listing**
   - Built `list` GlazeCommand: queries Drive `Files.List` with `mimeType='application/vnd.google-apps.form'`.
   - Supports `--sort` (`name|created|modified`), `--desc`, and `--limit` options; results include timestamps, owners, share URL.
   - Auth helper accepts extra scopes (Drive metadata) while preserving existing forms scope.

5. **Documentation & polish**
   - Updated README with new behaviours and Glazed formatting guidance.
   - Ensured commands register Glazed parameter layers so `--output`, `--select`, etc., work uniformly.
   - Repeated gofmt/go build cycles verified consistency.

## What Worked Well

- **Glazed pipeline adoption**: Switching fetch-submissions/list to `GlazeCommand` instantly provided table/JSON/CSV output, sorting/selection, and eased future UI integration.
- **Metadata approach**: Embedding DSL IDs in `ItemId`/`QuestionId` required no API changes, survived round-trips, and removed reliance on heuristics.
- **Reusable OAuth helper**: Extending `buildFormsAuthenticator` with variadic scopes kept authentication logic centralised.
- **Drive pagination helper**: Abstracting list call creation simplified pagination loops and captured field selections in one constant.

## Pain Points & Mitigations

- **Parameter layer composition**: Initial attempts to merge `*ParameterLayers` instances were clumsy. Outcome: prefer `WithLayersList` with clones and use built-in helpers; avoid manual merging when not necessary.
- **Required flags**: `uhoh` fields lack explicit `Required` attribute. Workaround: infer from validation rules; consider adding canonical field metadata upstream.
- **Metadata collisions**: When titles repeat, slugging alone collides. Encoding real IDs solved this; ensure creation path sets metadata consistently.
- **Drive scope**: Listing forms needs `drive.metadata.readonly`. We now pass additional scope explicitly when building the authenticator.

## Patterns & Guidelines for Future Work

1. **Always emit structured output**
   - For read/list commands, implement `GlazeCommand`. Register `settings.NewGlazedParameterLayers()` via `WithLayersList` for consistent CLI flags.

2. **Centralise OAuth scope handling**
   - Pass additional scopes through `buildFormsAuthenticator(parsedLayers, extraScopes...)`. Keep OAuth layer definitions in `pkg/google/auth`.

3. **Use metadata for idempotency**
   - When generating external resources, embed stable identifiers (base64 slug pattern) to preserve referential integrity.

4. **Leverage helper constructors**
   - Use `newDriveFormsListCall`, `emitSubmissionRows`, etc., to encapsulate API quirks (fields selection, pagination).

5. **Documentation cadence**
   - Update README (or docs topics) whenever CLI flags/behaviour change. Mention Glazed formatting capabilities explicitly.

## Known Gaps & Follow-up Ideas

- **Differential sync**: We still always delete/recreate items. Could explore diff-based patching for large forms.
- **Validation coverage**: Add unit tests for metadata encoding/decoding and submission row emission to guard against API schema changes.
- **Pagination limits**: Expose `--page-size` or streaming for very large form lists/submissions if needed.
- **Authentication UX**: Document new Drive scope requirement in onboarding instructions.
- **Required field fidelity**: Work with `uhoh` DSL to expose required flag directly instead of inferring from validation strings.

## Technical Notes

- Build command used for verification: `GOCACHE=$(pwd)/.gocache go build ./cmd/apps/form-generator`.
- New source files: `pkg/convert.go`, `pkg/fetch.go`, `pkg/fetch_submissions.go`, `pkg/list.go`, `pkg/metadata.go`.
- Key modified files: `pkg/form.go`, `pkg/generate.go`, `main.go`, `README.md`.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Add integration tests (Go or script) that exercise `generate -> fetch -> list -> fetch-submissions` round-trip against a mocked or real environment.
2. Expand documentation with end-to-end examples (wizard DSL → form → submissions) and mention new Drive listing command in release notes.
3. Evaluate storing metadata in a more structured way (e.g., `Form.Info.Description` JSON) if APIs ever allow server-side metadata.
4. Monitor API quotas/scopes when using Drive metadata; consider batching or caching results.

This report should provide the necessary context to continue iterating on `form-generator`, design regression tests, and apply the patterns we adopted here to future commands.
