# Technical Report: Investigating Intermittent Hangs During Resize in `bobatea` Conversation View

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Case:** The Case of the Hanging Terminal Query
**Component:** `bobatea/pkg/chat/conversation/model.go`
**Suspected Cause:** `termenv.HasDarkBackground()`

## 1. Introduction

Following the resolution of a startup hang in a separate Bubble Tea application (`bubbletea-markdown-test`) related to `glamour` markdown rendering (documented in `03-report-on-hanging-markdown-rendering-in-bubbletea-applications.md`), a similar performance issue was observed in the `bobatea` library's conversation component. Specifically, the UI would hang for approximately 5 seconds during terminal resize operations. This document details the debugging steps taken to isolate the cause of this hang.

## 2. Initial State and First Fix Attempt

The `bobatea` conversation model (`Model`) uses the `glamour` library to render markdown in chat messages. Initially, the `glamour.TermRenderer` was being recreated frequently.

Based on the findings from the previous investigation, the first step was to apply the "initialize once" pattern:
- The `glamour.TermRenderer` instance was moved from being created potentially many times during message rendering to being created only **once** in the `NewModel` function.
- A `SetWidth` method was added to the `Model` to handle terminal resize events. The initial implementation of `SetWidth` would recreate the `glamour.TermRenderer` using `glamour.NewTermRenderer` with the `glamour.WithAutoStyle()` and `glamour.WithWordWrap(newWidth)` options whenever the width changed.

## 3. Persistent Hang and Initial Logging (`bobatea`)

Despite the "initialize once" fix for the *base* renderer, the ~5-second hang persisted, specifically occurring when the terminal was resized, triggering the `SetWidth` method.

To investigate, detailed logging with timing was added to `bobatea/pkg/chat/conversation/model.go`, focusing on the `SetWidth` method:

```go
// Inside SetWidth(width int)
log.Debug().Int("newWidth", width).Int("currentWidth", m.width).Msg("SetWidth called")
startSetWidth := time.Now()
// ... width change check ...
log.Debug().Int("width", width).Msg("SetWidth: Preparing to recreate glamour renderer...")
startRenderer := time.Now()
renderer, err := glamour.NewTermRenderer(
    glamour.WithAutoStyle(),
    glamour.WithWordWrap(m.getRendererContentWidth()), // Helper calculates width based on m.width
)
durationRenderer := time.Since(startRenderer)
log.Debug().Dur("duration", durationRenderer).Int("width", width).Msg("SetWidth: glamour.NewTermRenderer call finished")
// ... handle error, invalidate cache ...
durationSetWidth := time.Since(startSetWidth)
log.Debug().Dur("totalDuration", durationSetWidth).Int("width", m.width).Msg("SetWidth finished")
```

Logs confirmed that the `SetWidth` function itself was being called correctly on resize, but the call to `glamour.NewTermRenderer(...)` within it was intermittently taking ~5 seconds.

Example Log Snippet:
```log
2025-04-06T17:26:36.4243684-04:00 DBG getRendererContentWidth finished duration=0.002883 ...
# --- Hang Starts Here ---
2025-04-06T17:26:43.691608511-04:00 DBG SetWidth: glamour.NewTermRenderer call finished duration=7267.234844 width=80
# --- Hang Ends Here ---
2025-04-06T17:26:43.691681-04:00 DBG SetWidth: Successfully recreated renderer width=80
...
2025-04-06T17:26:43.691848241-04:00 DBG SetWidth finished totalDuration=7267.515848 width=80
```

## 4. Deep Dive Logging (`glamour`) - Attempt 1

To understand where within `glamour.NewTermRenderer` the time was spent, logging was added to the `glamour` library itself (`thirdparty/glamour/glamour.go`).

The first attempt added basic timing around `NewTermRenderer` and the `WithWordWrap` option application:

```go
// Inside NewTermRenderer(...)
log.Debug().Msg("NewTermRenderer called")
start := time.Now()
// ... setup ...
for _, o := range options { // Apply options like WithAutoStyle, WithWordWrap
    if err := o(tr); err != nil { /* ... */ }
}
// ... set renderer ...
duration := time.Since(start)
log.Debug().Dur("duration", duration).Msg("NewTermRenderer finished successfully")

// Inside WithWordWrap(...) option function
log.Debug().Int("wordWrap", wordWrap).Msg("WithWordWrap option applying")
start := time.Now()
tr.ansiOptions.WordWrap = wordWrap
duration := time.Since(start)
log.Debug().Int("wordWrap", wordWrap).Dur("duration", duration).Msg("WithWordWrap option applied successfully")

```

Logs from this stage showed:
- `WithWordWrap` itself was extremely fast (microseconds).
- The ~5-second delay occurred *after* `NewTermRenderer` was called but *before* the `WithWordWrap` option's log message appeared. This indicated the delay was happening either during the initial setup of the `TermRenderer` struct or during the application of the *first* option (`glamour.WithAutoStyle`).

Example Log Snippet (Slow Case):
```log
# NewTermRenderer called immediately on resize
2025-04-06T17:34:07.877250512-04:00 DBG ../thirdparty/glamour/glamour.go:82 > NewTermRenderer called
# --- Approximately 5-second delay occurs HERE ---
# WithWordWrap (option 1) application is logged AFTER the delay
2025-04-06T17:34:12.882445855-04:00 DBG ../thirdparty/glamour/glamour.go:212 > WithWordWrap option applying wordWrap=157
2025-04-06T17:34:12.882539569-04:00 DBG ../thirdparty/glamour/glamour.go:216 > WithWordWrap option applied successfully duration=0.000135 wordWrap=157
# NewTermRenderer finishes, duration reflects the ~5s delay
2025-04-06T17:34:12.88258626-04:00 DBG ../thirdparty/glamour/glamour.go:117 > NewTermRenderer finished successfully duration=5005.314897
```

## 5. Deep Dive Logging (`glamour`) - Attempt 2 (Granular)

To pinpoint the exact step, more detailed logging was added *inside* `NewTermRenderer`, timing each major step: struct initialization, `goldmark.New()`, the options application loop (logging start/end of each option), `ansi.NewRenderer()`, and `tr.md.SetRenderer()`.

```go
// Inside NewTermRenderer(...)
log.Debug().Msg("NewTermRenderer called")
start := time.Now()

log.Debug().Msg("Initializing TermRenderer struct...")
startStruct := time.Now()
tr := &TermRenderer{ /* ... ansiOptions init ... */ }
durationStruct := time.Since(startStruct)
log.Debug().Dur("duration", durationStruct).Msg("TermRenderer struct initialized")

log.Debug().Msg("Calling goldmark.New()...")
startGoldmark := time.Now()
tr.md = goldmark.New(/* ... */)
durationGoldmark := time.Since(startGoldmark)
log.Debug().Dur("duration", durationGoldmark).Msg("goldmark.New() finished")

log.Debug().Msg("Applying options...")
startOptions := time.Now()
for i, o := range options {
    log.Debug().Int("optionIndex", i).Msg("Applying option...")
    startOption := time.Now()
    if err := o(tr); err != nil { /* ... error log ... */ }
    durationOption := time.Since(startOption)
    log.Debug().Int("optionIndex", i).Dur("duration", durationOption).Msg("Option applied successfully")
}
durationOptions := time.Since(startOptions)
log.Debug().Dur("duration", durationOptions).Msg("Finished applying options")

// ... log ansi.NewRenderer, tr.md.SetRenderer ...

duration := time.Since(start)
log.Debug().Dur("duration", duration).Msg("NewTermRenderer finished successfully")
```

## 6. Identifying the Slow Option: `WithAutoStyle`

The granular logs clearly showed the delay happening during the application of the *first* option (`optionIndex=0`):

Example Log Snippet (Slow Case):
```log
# ... (struct init, goldmark.New are fast) ...
2025-04-06T17:37:16.619398349-04:00 DBG ../thirdparty/glamour/glamour.go:110 > Applying options...
# Applying option 0 starts
2025-04-06T17:37:16.619425544-04:00 DBG ../thirdparty/glamour/glamour.go:113 > Applying option... optionIndex=0
# --- Approximately 5-second delay occurs HERE, within the execution of option 0 ---
# Option 0 finishes after ~5s
2025-04-06T17:37:21.626570693-04:00 DBG ../thirdparty/glamour/glamour.go:122 > Option applied successfully duration=5007.116563 optionIndex=0
# Option 1 (WithWordWrap) starts and finishes quickly
2025-04-06T17:37:21.626635091-04:00 DBG ../thirdparty/glamour/glamour.go:113 > Applying option... optionIndex=1
2025-04-06T17:37:21.626677634-04:00 DBG ../thirdparty/glamour/glamour.go:122 > Option applied successfully duration=0.026093 optionIndex=1
# Total options duration reflects the delay in option 0
2025-04-06T17:37:21.626691354-04:00 DBG ../thirdparty/glamour/glamour.go:125 > Finished applying options duration=5007.265839
# ... (ansi.NewRenderer, SetRenderer are fast) ...
```

In `bobatea/pkg/chat/conversation/model.go`, `optionIndex=0` corresponds to the `glamour.WithAutoStyle()` option passed to `NewTermRenderer`.

## 7. Tracing `WithAutoStyle` to `termenv.HasDarkBackground`

The `glamour.WithAutoStyle()` function is a wrapper around `WithStandardStyle(styles.AutoStyle)`:

```go
// glamour/glamour.go
func WithAutoStyle() TermRendererOption {
	return WithStandardStyle(styles.AutoStyle) // styles.AutoStyle is "auto"
}

func WithStandardStyle(style string) TermRendererOption {
	return func(tr *TermRenderer) error {
		styles, err := getDefaultStyle(style) // Calls getDefaultStyle("auto")
		// ... apply styles ...
	}
}

func getDefaultStyle(style string) (*ansi.StyleConfig, error) {
	if style == styles.AutoStyle { // style == "auto"
		if !term.IsTerminal(int(os.Stdout.Fd())) { // Check if TTY
			return &styles.NoTTYStyleConfig, nil
		}
		// THIS IS THE SUSPECTED SLOW CALL:
		if termenv.HasDarkBackground() {
			return &styles.DarkStyleConfig, nil
		}
		return &styles.LightStyleConfig, nil
	}
	// ... handle other styles ...
}
```

The call path leads directly to `termenv.HasDarkBackground()`, which queries the terminal (often using escape codes like `OSC 11 ; ? ST`) to determine its current background color.

## 8. Detailed Tracing with Full Call Path Instrumentation

To fully confirm the exact cause of the delay, we added extensive zerolog instrumentation to the entire call path from `glamour.WithAutoStyle` down through `termenv.HasDarkBackground`, `termenv.BackgroundColor`, and finally the terminal I/O operations in `termenv_unix.go`.

A complete trace from startup of the application revealed:

```log

6:12PM DBG ../thirdparty/termenv/termenv_unix.go:344 > termStatusReport called sequence=11
```

The log trace continues through the terminal query sequence. For brevity, key timestamps are highlighted below:

```log
# OSC Query sent
6:12PM DBG ../thirdparty/termenv/termenv_unix.go:417 > termStatusReport: Sending OSC query query="\x1b]11;?\x1b\\"
6:12PM DBG ../thirdparty/termenv/termenv_unix.go:425 > termStatusReport: Finished writing OSC query writeDuration=0.000943

# Finally, back to glamour
6:12PM DBG ../thirdparty/glamour/glamour.go:122 > Option applied successfully duration=8.793006 optionIndex=0
```

This detailed trace confirms that the delay primarily occurs in `termenv`'s OSC terminal query, specifically:

1. The entire operation takes ~9 seconds, with ~8.7 seconds in `termenv.HasDarkBackground()`
2. Most of the delay (~7.3s) is in the OSC 11 query response read, and a smaller delay (~0.9s) in reading the cursor position response
3. Individual `select` and `read` system calls are fast (typically <1ms each)
4. The bulk of the delay appears to be in waiting for the terminal to begin sending its response

The particularly important insight is that the delay seems to be terminal-dependent. The logs show the application using `xterm-kitty` as the terminal. Each individual byte read is fast once data becomes available, but there appears to be a significant delay between sending the OSC query and receiving the first byte of the response.

## 9. Conclusion and Hypothesis

The detailed logging strongly indicates that the intermittent ~5-9 second hangs observed during terminal resize in `bobatea` are caused by the `termenv.HasDarkBackground()` function taking an unexpectedly long time to execute. This happens when `glamour.NewTermRenderer` is called with the `glamour.WithAutoStyle()` option inside the `SetWidth` method, which is triggered by Bubble Tea's resize events.

The delay is not in the Go code itself but in the interaction with the terminal:
1. The application sends OSC 11 query to get background color
2. For some reason (likely terminal-dependent), the terminal takes several seconds to respond
3. Only after the terminal response is received can the application continue

Additionally, the logs show that each individual system call is fast, meaning the terminal is genuinely taking several seconds before responding to the OSC 11 query. This is further evidenced by the fact that the DSR query (cursor position) response is also slower than expected. This is consistent with terminals that might have OSC response support but execute them with lower priority than other terminal operations.

## 10. Solution Implemented

The fix implemented in `bobatea/pkg/chat/conversation/model.go` avoids calling `WithAutoStyle` (and thus `termenv.HasDarkBackground`) repeatedly:

1.  The terminal background color style (`"dark"`, `"light"`, or `"notty"`) is determined **once** in `NewModel` using `termenv.HasDarkBackground()` and stored in the `determinedStyle` field of the model.
2.  The `SetWidth` method was modified to recreate the renderer using `glamour.WithStandardStyle(m.determinedStyle)` instead of `glamour.WithAutoStyle()`.

This ensures the potentially slow terminal query happens only once at startup, not during resize events.

```go
// In NewModel
func NewModel() *Model {
    m := &Model{}
    
    // Determine the style once
    if termenv.HasDarkBackground() {
        m.determinedStyle = "dark"
    } else {
        m.determinedStyle = "light"
    }
    
    // Create initial renderer
    renderer, err := glamour.NewTermRenderer(
        glamour.WithStandardStyle(m.determinedStyle), // Use pre-determined style
        glamour.WithWordWrap(width),
    )
    // ...
}

// In SetWidth
func (m *Model) SetWidth(width int) {
    // ...
    renderer, err := glamour.NewTermRenderer(
        glamour.WithStandardStyle(m.determinedStyle), // Use pre-determined style instead of AutoStyle
        glamour.WithWordWrap(newWidth),
    )
    // ...
}
```

## 11. Next Steps and Recommendations

1. **Immediate Fix**: The solution of caching the background color style at startup works well for applications like `bobatea`. This should be implemented anywhere that `glamour.WithAutoStyle()` is used in contexts where it might be called repeatedly (e.g., resize events).

2. **Potential `termenv` Improvements**:
   - Consider adding a timeout mechanism or context support to `termenv.HasDarkBackground()` so applications can control how long they're willing to wait.
   - Add a caching layer in `termenv` itself, perhaps with a configurable cache duration.
   - Investigate if there are alternate terminal query mechanisms that might be more reliable or have better performance characteristics.

3. **Terminal Testing**: Test with various terminals (iTerm2, Terminal.app, Alacritty, Windows Terminal, etc.) to determine if the delay is specific to certain terminal emulators. It's possible some terminals have more optimized OSC query handling.

4. **For `glamour` Library**:
   - Consider modifying `glamour.WithAutoStyle()` to accept an optional pre-determined style value, reducing the need for terminal queries.
   - Add documentation warning developers about potential terminal I/O delays when using `WithAutoStyle()`.

5. **Enhanced Monitoring**: For applications where terminal responsiveness is critical, consider adding metrics to track terminal I/O performance over time, which might help identify degradation patterns.
