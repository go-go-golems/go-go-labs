## 1. Initial Explanation & Rationale

### Emrichen Overview

[Emrichen](https://emrichen.readthedocs.io/) is a YAML-based templating language. You can embed expressions into YAML using special tags and instructions, then execute these templates to produce a final YAML/JSON or text output. Typical usage includes:

```yaml
somefield: !Var MY_VARIABLE
somecomputedfield: !Format
  template: "Hello {user}, you have {messages} new messages."
  user: !Var USERNAME
  messages: !Var MESSAGE_COUNT
```

When you run Emrichen with a set of input variables or environment variables, it resolves all `!Var` references, does the formatting, and outputs a resolved YAML.

### go-faker/faker

[go-faker/faker](https://github.com/go-faker/faker) is a Go library that generates random data like names, addresses, phone numbers, and so on, with many specialized sub-functions. A typical usage in Go code might look like:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/go-faker/faker/v4"
)

type Example struct {
	Name     string  `faker:"name"`
	Email    string  `faker:"email"`
	Latitude float64 `faker:"lat"`
	Longitude float64 `faker:"long"`
}

func main() {
	var e Example
	_ = faker.FakeData(&e)
	fmt.Println(e)
}
```

But in your scenario, you want to have a **YAML DSL** that can produce an output document (also in YAML or JSON or something else) with random data. The random data generation is done by hooking into faker _somehow_ (either directly through an Emrichen plugin or via some CLI utility) but the key idea is that you want custom Emrichen tags that “call” the faker functionality.

### Why Custom Tags?

Emrichen can be extended with custom tags or macros. So the idea is to define something like `!Faker` or `!FakerAddress`, `!FakerLat`, etc. so that Emrichen knows: “When you see `!FakerEmail`, run the `faker.Email()` function and place that result in the template output.”

---

## 2. Examples

Below are several example YAML templates using a hypothetical set of custom Emrichen tags for faker. We’ll assume you have an Emrichen environment set up with a plugin or extension that interprets the `!Faker` tags.

### Example A: Simple Single-Field Usage

```yaml
user:
  name: !Faker
    function: name # calls faker.Name() internally
  email: !Faker
    function: email # calls faker.Email() internally
```

**Intended Output** (example):

```yaml
user:
  name: "Alice Baker"
  email: "alistair.test@example.com"
```

(Every time you run the template, you get new random data.)

### Example B: Different Faker Functions

```yaml
testdata:
  userProfile:
    username: !Faker
      function: username # calls faker.Username()
    password: !Faker
      function: password # calls faker.Password() with some default length
    ip: !Faker
      function: ipv4 # or ip
    creditCard: !Faker
      function: cc_number # hypothetical
    latlong:
      lat: !Faker
        function: lat
      long: !Faker
        function: long
```

**Potential Output**:

```yaml
testdata:
  userProfile:
    username: "sallyjenkins07"
    password: "n78%Ja0p"
    ip: "192.168.90.3"
    creditCard: "5559-6162-3759-3188"
    latlong:
      lat: 74.344355
      long: -21.741102
```

### Example C: Using Emrichen’s Other Features + Faker

Emrichen can do more than just a single substitution. You can combine them with loops, conditional logic, or variable references.

```yaml
people: !Loop
  over: !Range 3
  as: i
  do:
    id: !Expr "i + 1"
    name: !Faker
      function: name
    phone: !Faker
      function: phone_number
    profile:
      email: !Faker { function: email }
      country: !Faker { function: country }
```

When run, it might produce:

```yaml
people:
  - id: 1
    name: "John Smith"
    phone: "+1-202-555-0147"
    profile:
      email: "john.smith@example.com"
      country: "France"
  - id: 2
    name: "Anna Gold"
    phone: "+1-202-555-0172"
    profile:
      email: "anna.gold@example.com"
      country: "Brazil"
  - id: 3
    name: "Timothy Carter"
    phone: "+1-202-555-0245"
    profile:
      email: "timothy.carter@example.com"
      country: "Morocco"
```

### Example D: Parameterizing the Faker Tag

You might have a custom tag that takes parameters like `MinLength` and `MaxLength` for a `password`. For example:

```yaml
secrets:
  user: !Faker
    function: username
  pass: !Faker
    function: password
    minLength: 10
    maxLength: 20
```

**Potential Output**:

```yaml
secrets:
  user: "randUser112"
  pass: "C8$v9r0SeSnb"
```

## 3. Detailed Spec

Below is a speculative design for how you might define these custom tags in Emrichen to integrate with go-faker/faker. You’d have to implement an Emrichen “tag extension” in Python (or in Go if you have a specialized fork) that wraps each call to faker.

### General Tag: `!Faker`

**Syntax**:

```yaml
!Faker
function: <string> # The name of the faker function (e.g. name, email, password, lat, etc.)
[arguments...]: <anything> # Zero or more optional arguments, which depends on the function
```

**Behavior**:

1. During template rendering, Emrichen sees `!Faker`.
2. It reads the `function` field (e.g. “name”, “email”, etc.).
3. It calls the corresponding function in `go-faker/faker`.
4. It passes along any custom arguments (like `minLength`, `maxLength`, etc.) if your extension is coded to do so.
5. It replaces the entire YAML node with the result.

**Example**:

```yaml
field: !Faker
  function: name
```

This calls `faker.Name()` (in the Go library) and returns e.g. “Jane Smith.”

### Possible Functions

A non-exhaustive list (based on [faker’s docs](https://github.com/go-faker/faker#example)):

- **name**
- **email**
- **username**
- **password**
- **phone_number**
- **cc_number**
- **lat** / **long**
- **ipv4** / **ipv6** / **ip**
- **country**
- **city**
- **street_address**
- **zip** / **postcode**
- **uuid_hyphenated** / **uuid_digit**
- **timestamp** (random date/time)
- **date** / **time**
- **word** / **sentence** / **paragraph** (some libraries have these)

Your custom Emrichen extension for `!Faker` must map each `function` string to the corresponding method or tag in the `go-faker/faker` library.

### Extended Tag Behaviors

1. **Locale**: You could allow a user to set a “locale” parameter:

   ```yaml
   user: !Faker
     function: name
     locale: fr # or "de", "jp", "en_US", etc.
   ```

   This would instruct your extension to generate a name localized to French. (go-faker/faker might not do multi-locale out of the box for everything, so you’d need to see if it’s supported or if you’d manually do some localized data sets.)

2. **Constraints**: Functions like password might support constraints:

   ```yaml
   pass: !Faker
     function: password
     minLength: 12
     maxLength: 16
   ```

   Then your extension ensures the random password meets these constraints.

3. **Nested Data**: If your function returns an object or a structure, you can flatten it into the final YAML. For example, `address` might return a struct with city/state/zip. Then the DSL can either embed it or break it out.

---

## 4. List of “Nice to Have” Additions

1. **Localization**:

   - Provide a “locale” parameter that toggles how data is generated. E.g. names, addresses.
   - Possibly load custom local data sets for addresses or phone numbers in different countries.

2. **Constraints/Parameters**:

   - For numeric fields: `min` and `max`.
   - For text: `minLength` and `maxLength`.
   - For geolocation: bounding box constraints (a region in lat/long).

3. **Formatting**:

   - Maybe add an optional “format” parameter. For example, if you generate date/time, you could specify the exact format.

4. **Repeatable Seeds**:

   - For debugging or re-generation with consistent results, you might let users specify a `seed` parameter that seeds the faker RNG.

5. **Advanced Emrichen Features**:

   - Using `!If`, `!Loop`, `!Var`, and `!Include` to combine multiple templates or do logic-driven data generation.
   - Combining with `!Format` or `!Expr` for dynamic text or references to environment variables.

6. **Post-processing**:
   - Some functions might return strings that you want to further manipulate. For instance, if `faker.Email()` returns something but you want to forcibly uppercase it or do a substring. That can be done either with Emrichen’s `!Expr` or by building a more advanced custom tag.

## Putting It All Together

### Example: Larger YAML DSL

Below is a more complete example that ties everything together:

```yaml
# example-dsl.yml

!Include:
  # If you had a "global config" file or environment-based config, you could load them here
  - base-config.yml

testdata:
  # Generate 5 user records with random data
  users: !Loop
    over: !Range 5
    as: index
    do:
      id: !Expr "index + 1"
      name: !Faker
        function: name
      email: !Faker
        function: email
      address:
        street: !Faker
          function: street_address
        city: !Faker
          function: city
        country: !Faker
          function: country
      # Generate a password with constraints
      password: !Faker
        function: password
        minLength: 8
        maxLength: 12

  # Generate random coordinates in a bounding box
  location:
    lat: !Faker
      function: lat
      min: -10
      max: 10
    lon: !Faker
      function: long
      min: -5
      max: 5

  # Possibly a repeated structure for test
  multipleAddresses: !Loop
    over: [ "HQ", "BranchA", "BranchB" ]
    as: site
    do:
      name: !Expr "site"
      location:
        city: !Faker
          function: city
        phone: !Faker
          function: phone_number
```

**When rendered**, Emrichen processes all the `!Loop` constructs, calls the `!Faker` plugin for each field, and outputs standard YAML with random data.

---

### Summary & Next Steps

1. **Implement the Plugin**: You’d need a small Emrichen plugin in Python or a specialized fork. The plugin would parse the YAML node under `!Faker`, read the `function` key, and dispatch the call to the Go faker library (or to a local library that can produce random data in sync with go-faker/faker).
2. **Try Basic Usage**: Start with a minimal `!Faker function: name` usage.
3. **Expand**: Add more parameters (locale, constraints, etc.).

With that, you have a design for a flexible YAML-based DSL using Emrichen to produce templated documents with random data from go-faker/faker.

---

## Final Recap

- **We proposed** a simple `!Faker` tag with a `function` key that calls `go-faker/faker`.
- **We showed** multiple examples: single usage, loops, parameterized constraints, etc.
- **We presented** a detailed spec describing the syntax, typical usage, and optional extended features (locale, constraints, etc.).
- **We listed** a set of “nice to have” features, from localization to advanced constraints and repeatable seeds.

This structure should give you a solid starting point to build out Emrichen templates that generate random test data via `go-faker/faker`.
