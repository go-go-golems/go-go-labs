# Test Coverage Gap Analysis

## Current Implementation Status

After implementing 38+ test functions across 8 test files, let me analyze what test scenarios from the original proposal are **still missing**:

## ‚ùå MISSING TEST SCENARIOS

### 1. Large Data and Boundary Conditions
- **Maximum offset handling** (near uint64 limit) - NOT TESTED
- **Large content blocks** (multi-KB, 128KB max) - NOT TESTED  
- **Maximum file offset operations** - NOT TESTED
- **Segment size limits and overflow** - NOT TESTED

### 2. File Path and Hash Collision Scenarios  
- **Hash collisions** (different files, same pathHash) - NOT TESTED
- **PathHash changes for same file** (symlinks, renames) - NOT TESTED
- **Cross-process file access** (same file, different PIDs) - NOT TESTED
- **File descriptor reuse scenarios** - NOT TESTED

### 3. Diff Generation Integration
- **Text vs binary diff handling** - NOT TESTED
- **Line ending variations** (Unix, Windows, Mac) - NOT TESTED
- **Unicode and encoding edge cases** - NOT TESTED
- **Very large diffs** (multi-KB changes) - NOT TESTED
- **Whitespace-only changes** - NOT TESTED
- **Identical content writes** (no diff needed) - NOT TESTED

### 4. Advanced API Contract Validation
- **Offset range validation** (invalid/negative offsets) - NOT TESTED
- **Data length validation** (nil vs empty vs oversized) - NOT TESTED
- **Return value validation** (buffer length matching) - NOT TESTED
- **Error condition handling** - NOT TESTED

### 5. Complex File Modification Patterns
- **Append-only writes** (log files) - NOT TESTED
- **File truncation followed by new content** - NOT TESTED
- **Sparse file operations** (writes with large gaps) - NOT TESTED
- **File growth and shrinkage patterns** - NOT TESTED

### 6. Cache State Transitions and Recovery
- **Empty cache ‚Üí first read ‚Üí first write sequence** - PARTIALLY TESTED
- **Cache with data ‚Üí file deleted ‚Üí new file with same path** - NOT TESTED
- **Cache eviction during active operations** - NOT TESTED
- **Recovery from cache corruption scenarios** - NOT TESTED

### 7. Memory and Performance Edge Cases
- **Single segment exceeding per-file limit** - NOT TESTED
- **Memory pressure during concurrent operations** - NOT TESTED
- **Eviction ordering verification** (LRU correctness) - PARTIALLY TESTED
- **Memory accounting accuracy** - PARTIALLY TESTED

### 8. Data Corruption and Consistency
- **Segment data corruption detection** - NOT TESTED
- **Metadata consistency validation** - PARTIALLY TESTED
- **Concurrent modification detection** - NOT TESTED

## ‚úÖ WELL COVERED AREAS

- Basic segment merging and insertion
- Write invalidation and splitting
- Content reconstruction with gaps
- Basic concurrent access
- TTL expiration
- API compatibility basics
- Binary data integrity (basic)

## üìù PRIORITY FOR ADDITIONAL TESTS

### HIGH PRIORITY (Production Critical):
1. **Large data handling** - Test with 128KB segments, max offsets
2. **Hash collision handling** - Critical for multi-file scenarios  
3. **Memory limit edge cases** - Single large segment scenarios
4. **Error condition handling** - Invalid inputs, boundary conditions

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Robustness):
1. **File modification patterns** - Append-only, truncation scenarios
2. **Cache state transitions** - File deletion/recreation
3. **Diff integration** - Different content types and edge cases

### LOW PRIORITY (Nice to Have):
1. **Cross-process scenarios** - Multi-PID access
2. **Performance under pressure** - Heavy concurrent load
3. **Data corruption recovery** - Graceful degradation

## RECOMMENDATION

Add approximately **15-20 additional test functions** to cover the HIGH and MEDIUM priority gaps. This would bring total test coverage to 50+ functions and provide production-ready robustness.

The current implementation is **functionally complete** but needs these additional edge case tests for **production deployment confidence**.
