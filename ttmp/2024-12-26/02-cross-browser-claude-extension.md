# Cross-Browser Support for Claude Intercept Extension

Following the guidelines in `01-cross-env-extension.md`, we've implemented cross-browser support for the Claude Intercept Extension. This update enables the extension to work seamlessly in both Chrome and Firefox while maintaining a single codebase.

## Browser API Compatibility Layer

### WebExtension Polyfill Integration
- Added `browser-polyfill.min.js` from `webextension-polyfill@0.10.0`
- Implemented unified `browserAPI` constant for cross-browser compatibility
- Ensures consistent promise-based API behavior across browsers

### API Usage Standardization
```javascript
const browserAPI = typeof browser !== 'undefined' ? browser : chrome;
```
- Replaced all `chrome.*` API calls with `browserAPI.*`
- Unified message passing system between popup and background scripts
- Standardized download handling across browsers

## Firefox-Specific Adaptations

### Manifest Updates
```json
"browser_specific_settings": {
  "gecko": {
    "id": "claude-intercept@wesen.com",
    "strict_min_version": "57.0"
  }
}
```
- Added Firefox-specific manifest settings
- Set minimum Firefox version requirement
- Maintained manifest version 2 for maximum compatibility

### Extension ID and Versioning
- Implemented unique Firefox extension ID
- Ensured compatibility with Firefox's stricter extension requirements
- Maintained backward compatibility with Chrome

## UI and Functionality Updates

### Popup Interface
- Updated popup.html with cross-browser event handling
- Improved button responsiveness and status updates
- Enhanced error handling for both browsers

### Background Script Modifications
- Refactored request interceptor for cross-browser compatibility
- Updated artifact handling system
- Improved download management across browsers

## Build System Enhancements

### Multi-Browser Build Support
- Added separate build targets for Chrome and Firefox
- Implemented automated build process for both platforms
- Created distinct distribution directories for each browser

### Makefile Updates
```makefile
chrome:
    mkdir -p dist/chrome
    cp manifest.json dist/chrome/
    cp *.js dist/chrome/
    cp *.html dist/chrome/
    cd dist && zip -r chrome.zip chrome/

firefox:
    mkdir -p dist/firefox
    cp manifest.json dist/firefox/
    cp *.js dist/firefox/
    cp *.html dist/firefox/
    cd dist && zip -r firefox.zip firefox/
```
- Added separate build targets for each browser
- Streamlined packaging process
- Improved build artifact organization

## Testing and Verification
- Tested functionality in both Chrome and Firefox
- Verified artifact downloading in both browsers
- Confirmed cross-browser message passing
- Validated UI consistency across platforms

## Future Considerations
- Monitor for Manifest V3 requirements in Firefox
- Plan for potential API changes in future browser versions
- Consider adding support for additional browsers (Edge, Safari)
