## Bootstrap Integration in Film Development Timer

Enhanced the Film Development Timer application by integrating Bootstrap CSS directly into the shadow DOM of all Lit components. Created a base `BootstrapLitElement` class that automatically injects the Bootstrap stylesheet into each component's shadow root, ensuring proper styling while maintaining component encapsulation. This approach preserves the benefits of shadow DOM isolation while allowing components to use Bootstrap's styling classes. 

## Film Development Timer Usability Improvements

Enhanced the Film Development Timer application with several usability improvements:
- Made all optional steps unchecked by default to allow users to explicitly choose which steps they want to include
- Added a "Restart Step" button to allow users to restart the current processing step if needed
- Added a "+30s" button to extend the current step's duration by 30 seconds for more flexibility during development
- Added step navigation by clicking on steps in the process list, allowing users to quickly jump to any step

## Film Development Timer Code Restructuring

Refactored the Film Development Timer application to use a modular code structure:
- Split the monolithic JavaScript code into multiple files for better organization and maintainability
- Created separate modules for data, base components, selectors, timer, and the main application
- Implemented proper ES module imports/exports between files
- Improved code organization with a clear separation of concerns
- Added a dedicated CSS class for clickable elements
