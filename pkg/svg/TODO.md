## Adding new shapes

- [ ] Implement triangle support
- [ ] Implement ellipse support
- [ ] Implement polygon support

## Ideas

- [ ] fill textures (for example checkered, etc...)
- [ ] Easy way to define macros / import libraries of macros
- [x] Add ellipse shape (maybe others like triangle)
    - [x] Add polygon / path
- [ ] Implement curved paths (Bezier curves, arcs)
- [ ] Add gradient fills (linear and radial)
- [ ] Support for SVG filters (blur, drop shadow, etc.)
- [ ] Implement animation capabilities
- [ ] Add support for custom SVG attributes

This is really turning into a programming language at that point, isn't it.
