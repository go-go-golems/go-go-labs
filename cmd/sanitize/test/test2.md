5. **Task List**:
```json
{
    "tasks": [
        {
            "taskId": 1,
            "description": "Do the laundry",
            "dueDate": "2023-08-25",
            "completed": false
        },
        {
            "taskId": 2,
            "description": "Buy groceries
          
          sdflkjsdf",
            "dueDate": "2023-08-24",
            "completed": true
        }
    ]
}
```

Remember that JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It's based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language, but is considered language agnostic.
