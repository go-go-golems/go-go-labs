Certainly! Enhancing your YAML DSL to support more flexible and structured data extraction can significantly improve the versatility and usability of your HTML Content Extractor tool. Below are several feature suggestions along with examples and explanations on how to implement them.

## Feature Enhancements for YAML DSL

### 1. **Assembling Matched Selectors**

Different use cases require different ways of assembling the extracted data. Here are various methods you can incorporate:

#### a. **Concatenation into a Single String**

**Description**: Combine all matched elements into one large string, preserving their order.

**YAML Configuration Example**:

```yaml
selectors:
  - title: Combined Repository Information
    selector: ".markdown-body p, .markdown-body h2.heading-element"
    assemble: "concatenate"
```

**Output Example**:

```yaml
Combined Repository Information: >
  This is a description of the repository.
  Links:
```

#### b. **Individual Code Blocks with Formatting**

**Description**: Extract matched elements as separate code blocks, retaining their HTML or code formatting.

**YAML Configuration Example**:

```yaml
selectors:
  - title: Code Snippets
    selector: ".highlight pre"
    assemble: "code_blocks"
```

**Output Example**:

```yaml
Code Snippets:
  - |
    def example_function():
        print("Hello, world!")
  - |
    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
      include Pundit::Authorization
    end
```

#### c. **Lists of Extracted Elements**

**Description**: Store each matched element as an item in a list for easier iteration and manipulation.

**YAML Configuration Example**:

```yaml
selectors:
  - title: Repository Descriptions
    selector: ".markdown-body p"
    assemble: "list"
```

**Output Example**:

```yaml
Repository Descriptions:
  - "Pundit provides a set of helpers which guide you in leveraging regular Ruby classes and object oriented design patterns to build a straightforward, robust, and scalable authorization system."
  - "Another description paragraph."
```

#### d. **Hash Entries with Subtitles**

**Description**: Organize extracted data into key-value pairs, allowing for more structured and meaningful data representation.

**YAML Configuration Example**:

```yaml
selectors:
  - title: Repository Links
    selector: ".markdown-body ul li a"
    assemble: "hash"
    key_attribute: "text"
    value_attribute: "href"
```

**Output Example**:

```yaml
Repository Links:
  "API documentation for the most recent version": "https://example.com/api"
  "Source Code": "https://github.com/example/repo"
  "Contributing": "https://github.com/example/repo/contributing"
  "Code of Conduct": "https://github.com/example/repo/code_of_conduct"
```

**Note**: In this example, `key_attribute` and `value_attribute` specify which HTML attributes to use for keys and values in the hash. Adjust these based on your HTML structure.

### 2. **Nested Selectors for Structured Data Extraction**

Nested selectors allow you to define parent-child relationships, enabling the extraction of complex, hierarchical data structures. This is particularly useful for sections that contain multiple sub-elements.

#### a. **Section-Based Extraction with Subselectors**

**Description**: Define a parent selector to identify a section and then specify subselectors to extract nested data within that section.

**YAML Configuration Example**:

```yaml
selectors:
  - title: Repository Policies
    selector: ".markdown-body h2.heading-element"
    assemble: "hash"
    children:
      - title: Policy Details
        selector: "following-sibling::ul/li"
        assemble: "list"
```

**Output Example**:

```yaml
Repository Policies:
  Policy Details:
    - "API documentation for the most recent version"
    - "Source Code"
    - "Contributing"
    - "Code of Conduct"
```

#### b. **Complex Nested Structures with Multiple Levels**

**Description**: Handle deeper nesting by allowing multiple levels of parent and child selectors.

**YAML Configuration Example**:

```yaml
selectors:
  - title: Policies
    selector: ".HeaderMenu-dropdown"
    assemble: "hash"
    children:
      - title: Product Policies
        selector: ".HeaderMenu-dropdown .px-lg-4 ul li a"
        assemble: "list"
      - title: Explore Links
        selector: ".HeaderMenu-dropdown .px-lg-4 .px-lg-4 ul li a"
        assemble: "list"
```

**Output Example**:

```yaml
Policies:
  Product Policies:
    - "Actions"
    - "Security"
    - "Codespaces"
    - "GitHub Copilot"
    - "Code review"
    - "Issues"
    - "Discussions"
  Explore Links:
    - "All features"
    - "Documentation"
    - "GitHub Skills"
    - "Blog"
```

#### c. **Grouped Data Extraction**

**Description**: Group related data points together under a common parent key, enhancing data organization.

**YAML Configuration Example**:

```yaml
selectors:
  - title: Repository Statistics
    selector: ".repository-content"
    assemble: "hash"
    children:
      - title: Stars
        selector: "#repo-stars-counter"
        assemble: "single"
      - title: Forks
        selector: "#repo-network-counter"
        assemble: "single"
      - title: Contributors
        selector: ".Contributors .avatar"
        assemble: "list"
```

**Output Example**:

```yaml
Repository Statistics:
  Stars: "8.3k"
  Forks: "629"
  Contributors:
    - "Contributor1"
    - "Contributor2"
    - "Contributor3"
    # ... more contributors
```

### 3. **Additional Advanced Features**

To further enhance the flexibility and power of your YAML DSL, consider incorporating the following advanced features:

#### a. **Attribute Extraction**

**Description**: Extract specific attributes from matched elements, such as `href`, `src`, or custom data attributes.

**YAML Configuration Example**:

```yaml
selectors:
  - title: External Links
    selector: ".HeaderMenu-dropdown-link.Link--external"
    assemble: "list"
    attributes:
      - "href"
```

**Output Example**:

```yaml
External Links:
  - "https://github.com/docs"
  - "https://github.com/blog"
  - "https://github.com/partners"
```

#### b. **Conditional Extraction**

**Description**: Apply conditions to selectors to include or exclude elements based on certain criteria.

**YAML Configuration Example**:

```yaml
selectors:
  - title: Active Sections
    selector: ".section.active"
    assemble: "list"
    condition:
      attribute: "data-status"
      value: "enabled"
```

**Output Example**:

```yaml
Active Sections:
  - "Enabled Section 1"
  - "Enabled Section 2"
```

#### c. **Transformation Functions**

**Description**: Apply transformation functions to the extracted data, such as trimming whitespace, converting to uppercase, or parsing dates.

**YAML Configuration Example**:

```yaml
selectors:
  - title: Cleaned Repository Descriptions
    selector: ".markdown-body p"
    assemble: "list"
    transformations:
      - "strip"
      - "capitalize"
```

**Output Example**:

```yaml
Cleaned Repository Descriptions:
  - "Pundit provides a set of helpers which guide you in leveraging regular ruby classes and object oriented design patterns to build a straightforward, robust, and scalable authorization system."
```

#### d. **Multiple Assembly Strategies**

**Description**: Allow different assembly strategies within a single configuration by specifying them per selector or per child selector.

**YAML Configuration Example**:

```yaml
selectors:
  - title: Repository Overview
    selector: ".repository-overview"
    assemble: "hash"
    children:
      - title: Title and Description
        selector: ".overview-title, .overview-description"
        assemble: "concatenate"
      - title: Key Metrics
        selector: ".metrics .metric"
        assemble: "hash"
        key_attribute: "data-metric-name"
        value_attribute: "data-metric-value"
```

**Output Example**:

```

## Implementation Considerations

To support these enhanced features, you will need to modify your Python script accordingly. Here's a high-level overview of how to approach these enhancements:

1. **Assembly Strategies**:
   - **Concatenation**: Join all extracted texts with spaces or newlines.
   - **Code Blocks**: Preserve formatting using block-style YAML (`|`).
   - **Lists**: Store each extracted element as an item in a list.
   - **Hashes**: Use specified attributes for keys and values.

2. **Nested Selectors**:
   - Recursively process `children` selectors within a parent selector.
   - Maintain a hierarchical data structure in the output YAML.

3. **Attribute Extraction**:
   - Allow specifying which HTML attributes to extract.
   - Modify the extraction logic to handle attributes alongside text content.

4. **Transformation Functions**:
   - Implement a set of predefined transformations (e.g., `strip`, `capitalize`).
   - Allow users to specify transformations in the YAML config.

5. **Conditional Extraction**:
   - Implement conditional logic based on element attributes or content.
   - Define conditions in the YAML DSL and apply them during extraction.

6. **Error Handling and Validation**:
   - Validate YAML configuration for required fields.
   - Handle cases where selectors do not match any elements gracefully.

### Sample Python Code Enhancements

Below is a conceptual enhancement to the existing Python script to support some of the proposed features. Due to complexity, this example focuses on assembly strategies and nested selectors.

```python
import click
import yaml
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import sys

def apply_transformations(text, transformations):
    for transform in transformations:
        if transform == "strip":
            text = text.strip()
        elif transform == "capitalize":
            text = text.capitalize()
        # Add more transformations as needed
    return text

def extract_data(soup, config):
    def process_selector(soup, selector_config):
        title = selector_config.get('title')
        selector = selector_config.get('selector')
        assemble = selector_config.get('assemble', 'list')
        children = selector_config.get('children', [])
        attributes = selector_config.get('attributes', [])
        transformations = selector_config.get('transformations', [])

        elements = soup.select(selector)
        data = None

        if assemble == "concatenate":
            texts = [element.get_text(strip=True) for element in elements]
            data = "\n".join(texts)
        elif assemble == "code_blocks":
            data = [element.get_text() for element in elements]
        elif assemble == "list":
            if attributes:
                data = [element.get(attribute) for element in elements for attribute in attributes]
            else:
                data = [element.get_text(strip=True) for element in elements]
        elif assemble == "hash":
            key_attr = selector_config.get('key_attribute', 'text')
            value_attr = selector_config.get('value_attribute', 'href')
            data = {}
            for element in elements:
                key = element.get_text(strip=True) if key_attr == 'text' else element.get(key_attr)
                value = element.get(value_attr)
                data[key] = value
        elif assemble == "single":
            data = elements[0].get_text(strip=True) if elements else None

        # Apply transformations
        if transformations and isinstance(data, list):
            data = [apply_transformations(item, transformations) for item in data]
        elif transformations and isinstance(data, str):
            data = apply_transformations(data, transformations)

        # Process children recursively
        if children:
            child_data = {}
            for child in children:
                child_result = process_selector(soup, child)
                if child_result is not None:
                    child_data[child.get('title')] = child_result
            data = child_data

        return data

    extracted = {}
    for selector in config.get('selectors', []):
        extracted[selector.get('title')] = process_selector(soup, selector)
    return extracted

@click.command()
@click.option('--config', '-c', type=click.File('r'), required=True, help='YAML configuration file with selectors.')
def extract_content(config):
    """
    Extract content from HTML based on YAML-configured CSS selectors.
    """
    # Load YAML configuration
    config_data = yaml.safe_load(config)

    # Read HTML input from stdin
    html_input = sys.stdin.read()

    # Parse the HTML using BeautifulSoup
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html_input, 'html.parser')

    # Extract data based on configuration
    extracted_data = extract_data(soup, config_data)

    # Output the extracted data as YAML to stdout
    yaml_output = yaml.dump(extracted_data, default_flow_style=False, allow_unicode=True)
    sys.stdout.write(yaml_output)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    extract_content()
```

**Notes on the Enhanced Script**:

- **Transformations**: The `apply_transformations` function applies a series of text transformations to the extracted data.
- **Assembly Strategies**: The `process_selector` function handles different assembly strategies (`concatenate`, `code_blocks`, `list`, `hash`, `single`).
- **Nested Selectors**: The function recursively processes any `children` selectors, building a nested data structure.
- **Attribute Extraction**: For hash assemblies, you can specify which attributes to extract using `key_attribute` and `value_attribute`.
- **Error Handling**: Ensure that selectors gracefully handle cases where no elements are matched (e.g., returning `None` or empty lists).

### 5. **Example Usage with Enhanced YAML DSL**

Given the enhanced YAML DSL and the updated script, here's how you can use the tool to extract complex, nested, and structured data.

**Sample YAML Configuration (`config_enhanced.yaml`)**:
