## Introduction

SPRINT Standard is the basic film developer in SPRINT's B&W processing system. It comes as a liquid concentrate that must be diluted before use. One liter of STANDARD concentrate will make 10 liters of working solution to develop at least 50 rolls of film, or enough replenished solution to develop 110 rolls.

## Preparation

Dilute STANDARD concentrate 1:9 with water to make the desired volume. For example:

```
100 ml STANDARD B&W Film Developer concentrate
+ 900 ml water
= 1000 ml B&W Film Developer working solution
```

## Development Process

### Procedure Steps for B&W Negative Films

| Step | Process | Timing |
|------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Water Pre-wet | 1 minute |
| 2 | Develop | See Development Chart |
| 3 | Stop | 1 minute |
| 4 | Fix | 3 minutes |
| 5 | Water Pre-wash | 1 minute |
| 6 | Remove Fixer | 3 minutes |
| 7 | Water Wash | 5 minutes |
| 8 | Stabilize | 1 minute |
| 9 | Squeegee & Dry | - |

**Note:** Use all solutions at the temperature selected for Development.

## Development Timing Chart

SPRINT's development timing chart provides times based on temperature and film type:

| Chart Letter | 18°C/64.5°F | 20°C/68°F | 22°C/71.5°F | 24°C/75°F |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| L | 8:00 | 6:30 | 5:15 | 4:15 |
| M | 9:15 | 7:30 | 6:00 | 5:00 |
| N | 10:30 | 8:30 | 7:00 | 5:30 |
| O | 12:30 | 10:00 | 8:00 | 6:30 |
| P | 14:00 | 11:30 | 9:15 | 7:30 |
| Q | 16:00 | 13:00 | 10:30 | 8:30 |
| R | 18:00 | 15:00 | 12:30 | 10:00 |
| S | 21:00 | 17:00 | 14:00 | 11:15 |
| T | 25:00 | 20:00 | 16:00 | 13:00 |

*Times shown in minutes:seconds*

Find a convenient combination of Time and Temperature for development. Use any temperature 18-25°C / 64.5-77°F.

## Film Type Chart Letters

To find the correct development time, first identify the chart letter for your film type:

### Minimum Chart Letter Recommendations

| Agfa | Chart Letter | Ilford | Chart Letter | Kodak | Chart Letter |
|------|-------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------------|
| APX100 | N | PanF+ | N | 125PX | N |
| APX400 | R | FP4+ | N | 400TX | O |
| Fuji |  | HP5+ | O | T-MAX100 | O |
| Acros 100 | O | Delta100 | N | 400TMY | P |
| Neopan SS 100 | N | Delta400 | P | 3200TMZ | S* |
| Neopan400 | N | Delta3200 | S* |  |  |
| Neopan1600 | P | SFX200 | O |  |  |

*\* Recommend 2-8 solution at 75°F*

**Note:** These letters are recommended for films exposed in direct sunlight with high quality equipment to produce negatives for printing with a condenser enlarger or variable contrast paper with a #2 1/2 filter. See the website for infrared and sheet films.

## Capacity & Replenishment

1 liter of STANDARD 1:9 working solution will develop 400 square inches of film (5 rolls of 35mm 36 exposure or 120 film). With replenishment as directed, 1 liter of working solution will process ten times this amount of film.

To renew a volume of working solution which has been used to capacity, add STANDARD concentrate to it in the following proportions:

- 7.5 ml for each 35 mm 36 exposure or 120 roll
- 4.5 ml for each 35 mm 20 exposure roll
- 1 ml for every 10 square inches of sheet film

This replenishment returns the working solution to its fresh working condition and capacity. When replenished developer is used to capacity it may be replenished again, repeatedly, until a total of 4000 square inches has been developed per liter.

## Agitation Guidelines

Agitate continuously for the first minute of each step, and for 10-15 seconds at each minute thereafter. When development time is less than 6 minutes, agitate for 10-15 seconds of each half-minute thereafter. When development time is less than 3 minutes, agitate continuously.

Use only enough solution to cover reels, leaving an air space for thorough agitation with bubbles.

## Water Washing

Wash films with a complete exchange of water (empty & refill) three times per minute, even with automatic washers.

## Shelf Life

Stored at 25°C/77°F or lower, away from strong light, STANDARD has the following shelf life:

| Condition | Concentrate | Diluted 1:9 |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Unopened | at least 12 months | at least 1 month |
| Opened air-free | 6 months | full container with up to 25% air: 1 week |
| Opened with up to 25% air | 3 months | in open tray: 24 hours |

## Safety Precautions

**WARNING:** Sensitizer - may cause allergic reactions or asthma. Harmful if swallowed, inhaled or absorbed through skin. Prolonged exposure may be harmful. May cause mild skin and eye irritation.

### Precautions
- Avoid contact with eyes, skin or clothing
- Do not swallow
- Avoid breathing vapor or mist
- Wear chemical resistant gloves and apron (butyl rubber) and safety glasses with side shields or chemical goggles
- Ensure darkroom is ventilated with an exhaust fan to remove vapors
- Wash thoroughly after handling, and before eating, drinking or smoking

### First Aid
- **For Eye/Skin Contact:** Rinse eyes and/or skin with plenty of water for several minutes. Seek medical attention if irritation develops and persists.
- **For Inhalation:** Remove from area to fresh air. If not breathing, give artificial respiration. Get immediate medical attention. If breathing is difficult, give oxygen.
- **For Ingestion:** DO NOT induce vomiting. Give victim a glass of water. Get immediate medical attention. Do not give anything by mouth to an unconscious or convulsing person.
