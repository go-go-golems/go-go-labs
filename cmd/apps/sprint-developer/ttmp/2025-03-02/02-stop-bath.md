## Introduction

BLOCK is the basic stop bath for all SPRINT SYSTEMS processes. It effectively stops development while minimizing the negative side effects associated with conventional acid stop baths.

## Advantages Over Conventional Stop Baths

In conventional stop baths, the acid ingredient which stops development is hazardous and unpleasant to use, and can damage prints. Acid can break down print sizing which normally protects fibers from fixer thiosulfate contamination, a major cause of deterioration. Plain water stop baths eliminate the side-effects of acid, but do not stop development as effectively, and can cause stains, emulsion swelling and reticulation.

BLOCK is an acid solution, but the acids are buffered to minimize the side-effects. Buffering protects print fibers for greater permanence, reduces emulsion swelling, staining, reticulation, and eliminates odors. BLOCK will also prevent carbonate gas ruptures of films (pinholes) when used as directed.

When used with other SPRINT B&W printing products, it signals the exhaustion of all baths simultaneously. Always use BLOCK before fixing with alum hardener to provide the correct acid value.

## Preparation

Dilute BLOCK Stop Bath concentrate 1:9 with water to make the desired volume of working solution. For example:

```
100 ml BLOCK Stop Bath concentrate
+ 900 ml water
= 1000 ml BLOCK Stop Bath working solution
```

One liter of concentrate will make 10 liters of working solution, enough for six-hundred 8x10 fiber prints or nine-hundred 8x10 resin-coated prints or six-hundred rolls of film.

## Usage Guidelines

### How to Use
- **Films:** Immerse for at least 1 minute.
- **Prints:** Immerse for at least 3 seconds.

Agitate continuously for the first minute, and for 10-15 seconds of each minute thereafter.

Use Stop Bath solution at the same temperature as the developer solution unless otherwise directed in your processing instructions.

## Capacity & Indicator

One liter of BLOCK Stop Bath working solution will process at least:
- 60 8x10 fiber prints
- or 90 8x10 resin-coated prints
- or 60 rolls of 35mm 36 exposure film or equivalent

BLOCK working solution changes color from yellow to lavender as it approaches exhaustion in b&w printing. When printing with SPRINT's QUICK SILVER Print Developer, BLOCK, and RECORD Speed Fixer, mixed in equal volumes, BLOCK indicates the exhaustion of all three solutions.

## Hardening Stop Bath

BLOCK may be converted into a hardening stop bath for sepia toning, or to replace hardening in the fixer if sulfur dioxide vapors must be minimized. Substitute the following converted solution for the normal stop bath and immerse films or prints for 3-6 minutes with agitation:

```
40 ml BLOCK Stop Bath concentrate
60 ml ARCHIVE Fixer Remover concentrate
900 ml water
+ 30 ml RECORD Alum Hardening Converter
= 1030 ml Hardening Stop Bath working solution
```

Use these proportions when mixing other quantities.

## Shelf Life

Stored as concentrate or working solution, with or without air in the container, BLOCK has a shelf life of at least 2 years.

## Safety Precautions

**WARNING!** Causes eye irritation. Breathing vapor or mist may cause asthma like symptoms. May be harmful if swallowed. May cause mild skin irritation.

### Precautions
- Avoid contact with eyes, on skin or on clothing
- Do not swallow
- Avoid breathing vapor or mist
- Wear chemical resistant gloves and apron (Neoprene) and safety glasses with side shields or chemical goggles
- Ensure darkroom is ventilated with an exhaust fan to remove vapors
- Wash thoroughly after handling, and before eating, drinking or smoking

### Handling, Storage & Disposal
- Keep container closed when not in use
- Store away from bases, oxidizers, and incompatible materials, in a cool, well-ventilated area
- Absorb spills with kitty litter, sand or earth and package in a suitable container for disposal
- Do not reuse container

### First Aid
- **For Eye Contact:** Immediately rinse eyes with water. Remove any contact lenses, and continue flushing with water for at least 15 minutes. Hold eyelids apart to ensure rinsing of the entire surface of the eyes and lids with water. Get immediate medical attention.
- **For Skin Contact:** Wash affected areas with plenty of water, and soap if available, for several minutes. Seek medical attention if irritation develops and persists.
- **For Inhalation:** Remove from area to fresh air. If not breathing, give artificial respiration. Get immediate medical attention. If breathing is difficult, give oxygen.
- **For Ingestion:** DO NOT induce vomiting. Give victim a glass of water. Get immediate medical attention. Do not give anything by mouth to an unconscious or convulsing person.
