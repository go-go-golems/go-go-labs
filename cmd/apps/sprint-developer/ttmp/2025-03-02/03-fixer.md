## Introduction

RECORD is the basic fixer for all SPRINT SYSTEMS processes. RECORD works quickly with a favorable pH to fix prints before thiosulfate absorption can reach damaging levels, and to promote thorough washing for permanence.

RECORD Speed Fixer can also be converted into a hardening fixer for b&w films and prints by adding RECORD Alum Hardening Converter (packaged separately).

## Preparation

### For Film Fixer
Dilute RECORD Speed Fixer concentrate 2:8 with water. For example:
```
200 ml RECORD Speed Fixer concentrate
+ 800 ml water
+ 30 ml RECORD Alum Hardening Converter (optional)
= 1030 ml Film Fixer working solution
```

### For Print Fixer
Dilute RECORD Speed Fixer concentrate 1:9 with water. For example:
```
100 ml RECORD Speed Fixer concentrate
+ 900 ml water
= 1000 ml Print Fixer working solution
```

### For Fast Print Fixer
Dilute RECORD Speed Fixer concentrate 2:8 with water. For example:
```
200 ml RECORD Speed Fixer concentrate
+ 800 ml water
= 1000 ml Fast Print Fixer working solution
```

### For Hardening Print Fixer
Dilute RECORD Speed Fixer concentrate 1:9 with water, then add hardener. For example:
```
100 ml RECORD Speed Fixer concentrate
+ 900 ml water
+ 15 ml RECORD Alum Hardening Converter
= 1015 ml Hardening Print Fixer working solution
```

## Usage Guidelines

### How to Use
- Immerse b&w films and prints for 3 minutes. Agitate continuously for the first minute, and for 10-15 seconds of each minute thereafter.
- Use non-hardening fixer for b&w prints only.
- Prints may be left in non-hardening fixer for at least 10 minutes without bleach damage. To reduce print fixing time, use the Fast Print Fixer solution for 30 seconds only with constant agitation.
- Use hardening fixer for all b&w films and some b&w prints.
- Use BLOCK Stop Bath before fixing to provide the correct acid value for hardening. Hardening increases with immersion time.
- For very rapid print fixing with hardener, immerse in Film Fixer solution for 30 seconds only with constant agitation.

### Print Finishing Notes
- Resin-coated prints should be hardened in the fixer for a hard-gloss finish; without hardening they will have a soft gloss finish.
- Fiber prints should not be hardened except under certain circumstances. Excessive hardening can make prints brittle and difficult to wash and tone.
- Correctly timed hardening and washing with ARCHIVE Fixer Remover will ensure best results.

## Capacity

One liter of RECORD Speed Fixer working solution will process at least:
- 60 8x10 fiber prints
- or 90 8x10 resin-coated prints
- or 30 rolls of 35mm, 36 exposure film or equivalent

The fixing capacity of RECORD is not affected by addition of RECORD Alum Hardening Converter.

## Shelf Life

RECORD Speed Fixer concentrate, stored with up to 25% air in the container, has a shelf life of at least 2 years.

RECORD Speed Fixer working solutions without hardener have the following shelf life:
- Full container: 12 months
- With up to 25% air: 2 months
- Uncovered tray: 2 weeks

Working solutions with added Alum Hardening Converter have approximately one-half this shelf life.

## Odor Information

RECORD Speed Fixer alone has no objectionable odor. When RECORD Alum Hardening Converter is added, a slight odor is generated by sulfur dioxide vapors.

## Safety Precautions

**WARNING:** May cause allergic skin or respiratory reaction. May cause or aggravate asthma. Breathing mist or vapor may cause respiratory irritation. Prolonged contact may cause skin or eye irritation.

### Precautions
- Avoid contact with the eyes, skin or clothing
- Do not swallow
- Avoid breathing vapor or mist
- Wear chemical resistant gloves and apron (butyl rubber) and safety glasses with side shields or chemical goggles
- Ensure darkroom is ventilated with an exhaust fan to remove vapors
- Wash thoroughly after handling, and before eating, drinking or smoking

### Handling, Storage and Disposal
- Keep container closed when not in use
- Store away from acids, bases, strong oxidizers, and incompatible materials, in a cool, well-ventilated area
- Absorb spills with kitty litter, sand or earth and package in a suitable container for disposal
- Do not reuse container

### First Aid
- **For Inhalation:** Remove from area to fresh air. If not breathing, give artificial respiration. Get immediate medical attention. If breathing is difficult, give oxygen.
- **For Eye/Skin Contact:** Rinse eyes and/or skin with plenty of water for several minutes. Seek medical attention if irritation develops and persists.
- **For Ingestion:** DO NOT induce vomiting. Give victim a glass of water. Get medical attention to determine whether vomiting or evacuation of stomach is necessary. Do not give anything by mouth to an unconscious or convulsing person.
