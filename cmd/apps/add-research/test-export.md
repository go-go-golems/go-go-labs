Below is a **drop-in recipe** for turning the generic OAuth + SSE sample into a **GitHub-only connector that rejects every request unless the bearer token really belongs to *your* GitHub account**.

---

## 1 · Why GitHub is a special-case OAuth provider

GitHub **does not issue OIDC/JWT ID-tokens**, it only returns opaque access-tokens such as `gho_xxx`. That means you can’t verify a signature locally the way you would with Auth0 or Okta.
Instead you prove the token is (a) valid *and* (b) bound to the correct user by asking GitHub’s REST API:

1. **Lightweight check** – call **`GET /user`** with the token; parse the `login` or `id` field and compare to an allow-list. Requires the `read:user` (or legacy `user`) scope. ([docs.github.com][1])
2. **Strict check** – call **`POST /applications/{client_id}/token`** (a.k.a. the *“Check a token”* endpoint) using **Basic auth** =`client_id:client_secret`.
   GitHub returns the token’s scopes *and* the user object; invalid/expired tokens get `404`. ([docs.github.com][2])

Either path works; the second lets you skip an extra scope and rate-limit failures more cleanly.

---

## 2 · Register a tiny OAuth App

1. **New OAuth App** → *Settings › Developer settings › OAuth Apps*.
2. **Authorization callback URL**: ChatGPT supplies its own redirect; you can temporarily use `http://127.0.0.1/ignore` – the value isn’t used during the connector flow.
3. **Scopes**: only `read:user` (or none if you’ll use 2️⃣ above).
4. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

---

## 3 · Patch your `main.go`

```go
// ─── 0. Config ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
var (
    ghClientID     = os.Getenv("GITHUB_CLIENT_ID")
    ghClientSecret = os.Getenv("GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET")
    allowedLogin   = os.Getenv("GITHUB_ALLOWED_LOGIN") // e.g. "manuelod"
)

// ─── helper: confirm token belongs to the allowed GitHub account ─────────────
func githubTokenValid(ctx context.Context, token string) (bool, error) {
    // OPTION A – quick /user call (needs read:user scope)
    req, _ := http.NewRequestWithContext(ctx, "GET", "https://api.github.com/user", nil)
    req.Header.Set("Authorization", "Bearer "+token)
    req.Header.Set("Accept", "application/vnd.github+json")
    resp, err := http.DefaultClient.Do(req)
    if err != nil || resp.StatusCode != 200 {
        return false, err
    }
    defer resp.Body.Close()
    var u struct{ Login string }
    if err := json.NewDecoder(resp.Body).Decode(&u); err != nil {
        return false, err
    }
    return u.Login == allowedLogin, nil

    // OPTION B – stricter introspection endpoint (no extra scopes)
    /*
    body := bytes.NewBufferString(fmt.Sprintf(`{"access_token":"%s"}`, token))
    r, _ := http.NewRequestWithContext(ctx, "POST",
        "https://api.github.com/applications/"+ghClientID+"/token", body)
    r.SetBasicAuth(ghClientID, ghClientSecret)
    r.Header.Set("Accept", "application/vnd.github+json")
    resp, err := http.DefaultClient.Do(r)
    // 200 = valid; 404 = invalid/expired
    */
}

// ─── 3’. Auth middleware that calls the helper ───────────────────────────────
authMW := func(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
    return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        raw := r.Header.Get("Authorization")
        if !strings.HasPrefix(raw, "Bearer ") {
            http.Error(w, "missing bearer", http.StatusUnauthorized)
            return
        }
        ok, err := githubTokenValid(r.Context(), raw[len("Bearer "):])
        if err != nil || !ok {
            http.Error(w, "unauthorized", http.StatusUnauthorized)
            return
        }
        next.ServeHTTP(w, r)
    })
}
```

### What changed?

* We **removed the OIDC verifier** (GitHub doesn’t emit JWTs).
* Auth middleware now calls `githubTokenValid`, which:

  * **GET /user** → verifies the token and extracts `login`. If it doesn’t match `GITHUB_ALLOWED_LOGIN`, we 401.
  * *(alt.)* Hits **`/applications/{client_id}/token`** with Basic-auth (`client_id:client_secret`) for a cryptographic validity check and the same user object.

## 4 · Update the manifest ChatGPT reads

```jsonc
// .well-known/ai-plugin.json
{
  "name": "Go-GitHub MCP",
  "description": "Streams search data, locked to a single GitHub account",
  "auth": {
    "type": "oauth",
    "authorization_url": "https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize",  // :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
    "token_url":         "https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token",// :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
    "scopes": ["read:user"]                                           // or [] with option B
  }
}
```

ChatGPT now knows to send the user through GitHub’s consent screen (they’ll approve `read:user` once), then call `/sse` with the resulting `gho_…` token.

---

## 5 · Run & test

```bash
export GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=Iv1.xxxxx
export GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=shhh
export GITHUB_ALLOWED_LOGIN=manuelod
go run .
```

1. **Add connector** → enter your server URL.
2. ChatGPT opens `https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?...` ; you log in.
3. Token comes back; ChatGPT calls `/sse` with that token.
4. Middleware calls GitHub, sees `login=="manuelod"`, and allows the stream.
5. Any other GitHub user? `401 Unauthorized`.

---

### Production hardening checklist

| Area                                                                                                                                    | Recommendation |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **Rate-limit** the `/user` or `/token` calls – GitHub API is 5 k req/h per user.                                                        |                |
| **Cache** token→user mapping for its lifetime (`expires_at` from check-token response) to avoid calling GitHub on every SSE keep-alive. |                |
| Use **option B** (`/applications/{client_id}/token`) in prod – avoids needing the `read:user` scope and lets you see token expiry.      |                |
| Rotate **client secret** via environment variables or a secrets manager – never bake it in code.                                        |                |
| Bind the connector URL to **HTTPS**; GitHub requires redirect URIs on HTTPS in production.                                              |                |

With these tweaks you have a **GitHub-gated MCP server**: ChatGPT can only access it when the bearer token represents *your* GitHub identity, giving you a quick personal sandbox without standing up a full IdP.

# Microservices Research

Perfect. I’ll gather all verified framework specifications, protocol documentation, best practices, and annotated Go examples required to build a secure, production-ready remote MCP server for ChatGPT’s web UI. The final output will be structured like a developer onboarding guide, including chapters that explain the Model Context Protocol (MCP), OAuth 2.1 flows, Go SDK usage (`mcp-go`), and deployment security.

I’ll update you as soon as everything is ready.


# Building an OAuth-Secured MCP Server for ChatGPT Web UI

## Understanding MCP and Remote Connectors

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that allows AI models (like ChatGPT) to connect with external tools and data in a uniform way. It’s often described as *“a USB-C port for AI applications,”* meaning it standardizes how AI connects to different resources. In practical terms, MCP defines a client-server architecture: ChatGPT (the client) can communicate with one or more **MCP servers** – lightweight programs exposing certain capabilities (data sources, APIs, actions) via a standardized interface. By using MCP, a tool integration built for one AI platform can work with others, avoiding one-off custom APIs.

**Remote MCP connectors in ChatGPT:** OpenAI has begun supporting MCP-based **connectors** in ChatGPT’s interface, allowing users to link ChatGPT with external services. For example, HubSpot built the first third-party MCP connector for ChatGPT’s plugin registry, enabling ChatGPT to query CRM data via an MCP server. Unlike local plugins, a remote MCP server runs on the web and communicates with ChatGPT over HTTP, so users don’t need to install anything locally. This remote setup requires robust authentication (since the server is accessible over the internet) and a communication protocol (to stream data back and forth). We’ll cover how to implement both using Go.

## MCP Communication: JSON-RPC over SSE

MCP messages are encoded in **JSON-RPC 2.0** format. Every request from ChatGPT to the server (e.g. to call a tool or fetch data) and the corresponding responses follow JSON-RPC’s `{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": ..., "params": ... }` structure. The transport layer defines *how* these JSON messages are exchanged. MCP supports two main transport mechanisms for remote servers:

* **HTTP + Server-Sent Events (SSE):** The original MCP remote transport uses an HTTP SSE stream for server->client messages (allowing streaming results), coupled with HTTP requests for client->server messages. In the SSE flow, the server exposes a **connection endpoint** (usually via `GET`) that the client uses to establish an event stream, and a **messages endpoint** (via `POST`) for sending JSON-RPC commands. Upon connect, the server replies with an initial `"endpoint"` event indicating where to POST subsequent messages. Thereafter, the client sends requests to that endpoint, and the server pushes responses/events over the open SSE channel. This mechanism enables asynchronous, real-time updates.

* **Streamable HTTP:** A newer, simplified approach (part of the 2025 spec) where each JSON-RPC request is an HTTP POST and the server *optionally* keeps the HTTP response open to stream multiple events (using `Content-Type: text/event-stream`). Streamable HTTP essentially formalizes the SSE pattern without a separate handshake, making it easier to manage stateless requests. ChatGPT’s connectors are moving toward this **streamable** method (for flexibility and easier load balancing), but may maintain backward compatibility with SSE.

In our Go implementation, we will use the SSE transport for simplicity (the Go MCP SDK’s current examples use SSE). Just note that the principles are similar for streamable HTTP. The server will expose an endpoint (e.g. `/sse`) that ChatGPT connects to for an event stream, and it will handle incoming JSON-RPC messages over HTTP.

## Setting Up the Go MCP Server Core

To implement the MCP server in Go, we’ll use the **`mcp-go` SDK**, which provides high-level abstractions for building MCP servers and clients. The code outline given in the question is a great starting point. Let’s break it down into steps and elaborate on each:

**1. Initialize the MCP server:** We create a new server instance with a name and version. For example:

```go
mcpSrv := mcp.NewServer("Go SSE MCP Demo", "0.1.0")
```

This sets up an MCP server object with no capabilities yet. The name and version are metadata (useful for discovery or logging).

**2. Register server capabilities (tools/resources):** Our server needs to expose some functionality to ChatGPT. MCP servers can provide *tools* (actions the LLM can invoke) and/or *resources* (data the LLM can retrieve as context). In this demo, we implement a simple **search-and-fetch** interface:

* **Search:** We register a “search” handler via `mcpSrv.RegisterSearch(...)`. This function will be called when the client (ChatGPT) sends a search request (e.g. the LLM wants to find information). In our code, the search handler ignores the query and just returns a dummy result for demonstration. It streams one `SearchResult` item and then closes the stream. In a real server, you would integrate your backend search logic here – e.g. query a database or API, then stream back a list of results. Each `SearchResult` includes an `Id`, `Title`, `Url`, and a text snippet (`Chunk`). The idea is similar to how a web browsing plugin might return search hits with brief summaries.

  ```go
  mcpSrv.RegisterSearch(func(ctx context.Context, req mcp.SearchRequest) (mcp.SearchStream, error) {
      stream := make(mcp.SearchStream, 1)
      go func() {
          // Example result
          item := mcp.SearchResult{
              Id:    "demo-1",
              Title: "Hello from Go!",
              Url:   "https://example.com/hello",
              Chunk: "This is a minimal MCP SSE server written in Go.",
          }
          stream <- item    // send result
          close(stream)     // close stream when done
      }()
      return stream, nil
  })
  ```

  *How this works:* When ChatGPT’s agent decides to use the “search” capability, it will send a JSON-RPC request that the SDK maps to our handler. We respond by returning a channel (`SearchStream`) of results. The MCP SDK will read from this channel and forward each item as an SSE **event** over the open connection to ChatGPT. Streaming the results one by one is important for responsiveness – the user can start seeing the first results before the last one is ready.

* **Fetch:** We also register a “fetch” handler via `mcpSrv.RegisterFetch(...)`. This corresponds to retrieving the full content of an item given its `Id`. In the context of a search tool, think of this as clicking a search result – ChatGPT might follow up by requesting the full text of the result to read it. Our example implementation simply returns a placeholder text (“Full text for {Id}”). In practice, you would use the `Id` (or URL) to fetch the actual content (for example, download the web page or retrieve a document from storage). The return type is `mcp.FetchResult` containing an `Id` (echoing the request) and the data. We wrap plain text in `mcp.Text(...)` to indicate the content is textual; the protocol also supports binary data via `mcp.Blob` if needed.

  ```go
  mcpSrv.RegisterFetch(func(ctx context.Context, req mcp.FetchRequest) (mcp.FetchResult, error) {
      return mcp.FetchResult{
          Id:   req.Id,
          Data: mcp.Text("Full text for " + req.Id),
      }, nil
  })
  ```

  Together, **Search** and **Fetch** form a simple information retrieval interface. Many MCP servers use a similar pattern: for example, a documentation server might let the LLM search for documents, then fetch the relevant ones. Under the hood, these are typically implemented as MCP *resource* queries (search might map to a `resources/list` or a custom tool, and fetch to `resources/read`). The Go SDK abstracts these details by providing high-level register functions. The key takeaway is that by registering these handlers, we’ve taught our server how to respond to specific client requests.

**3. Wrap the server with SSE transport:** After defining the server’s functionality, we need to expose it over HTTP so ChatGPT can connect. The `mcp-go` SDK offers an SSE transport module for this. In the code, this is done by:

```go
sseHandler := sse.NewServer(mcpSrv)
```

This creates an HTTP handler (`sseHandler`) that knows how to handle MCP communication via Server-Sent Events. We will mount this handler on a route (e.g. `/sse`). The SSE transport takes care of the protocol handshake and message framing. Conceptually, when ChatGPT connects:

* It will issue an HTTP GET request to the `/sse` endpoint to open the SSE stream (the SDK will then handle sending the initial JSON handshake event if needed, and keeping the connection alive).
* When ChatGPT sends a JSON-RPC message (like a search request), the SDK will receive it (likely via an HTTP POST or as part of the SSE channel) and dispatch to the appropriate handler (the ones we registered above).
* Any results our handlers produce are sent back as SSE events on the open connection.

The details of the SSE implementation (session IDs, endpoints) are managed by the library. Historically, the SSE flow involves the server sending an `"endpoint"` event with a session-specific URL for subsequent calls, but newer implementations may simplify that. As developers, we mainly ensure the `/sse` route is served and protected. The `sseHandler` will internally listen for JSON-RPC requests and stream responses. This approach aligns with the MCP specification’s description of **HTTP+SSE transport**.

We mount the SSE handler and secure it in the next steps.

## Integrating OAuth 2.0 for Authentication

Because our MCP server is remote and accessible via the web, **user authentication and authorization are crucial**. We only want authorized ChatGPT users to access their own data/tools on our server. The recommended approach (and what ChatGPT connectors use) is **OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect (OIDC)** for user login. In practice, this means when a user adds our tool to ChatGPT, they’ll be prompted to log in via an OAuth provider, and ChatGPT will obtain an **access token or ID token** to act on the user’s behalf. Every request from ChatGPT to our server will include an `Authorization: Bearer ...` token header, which we must verify.

Our Go server uses the **coreos/go-oidc** library to handle token verification against an OIDC provider. Here’s how to set it up:

* **OIDC Provider Setup:** We assume you have an OAuth/OIDC provider (such as Auth0, Okta, or Azure AD) configured for your app. You’ll need an **Issuer URL** (e.g. `https://YOUR_DOMAIN.auth0.com/`) and a **Client ID** for a public OAuth client. In code, we read these from environment variables `OAUTH_ISSUER` and `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`. The `issuer` is the base URL of the OIDC provider, and `clientID` is the OAuth client application ID. In our scenario, ChatGPT will use this client to obtain tokens. (Often, the client is created as a *public* app with no client secret, using PKCE for security.)

  We initialize the OIDC provider with:

  ```go
  provider, err := oidc.NewProvider(context.Background(), issuer)
  ```

  This fetches the provider’s configuration (from `/.well-known/openid-configuration` under the hood). Then we create a token **verifier**:

  ```go
  verifier := provider.Verifier(&oidc.Config{ClientID: clientID})
  ```

  This configures the verifier to accept tokens intended for our client ID. Essentially, we’re stating that tokens **must** have our Client ID in their audience (`aud`) claim to be considered valid. (In OIDC, an ID Token’s `aud` is the client ID, and access tokens can also have audience claims.)

* **Auth Middleware:** We next wrap the `/sse` endpoint with middleware that enforces Bearer token auth. The code does:

  ```go
  authMW := func(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
      return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
          raw := r.Header.Get("Authorization")
          if raw == "" {
              w.WriteHeader(http.StatusUnauthorized)
              return
          }
          tokenString := raw[len("Bearer "):]
          _, err := verifier.Verify(r.Context(), tokenString)
          if err != nil {
              w.WriteHeader(http.StatusUnauthorized)
              return
          }
          next.ServeHTTP(w, r)
      })
  }
  ```

  This middleware checks for an `Authorization` header. If missing or if verification fails, it returns 401 Unauthorized. Otherwise it calls the next handler (our SSE server). The `verifier.Verify` method will parse and validate the JWT token – verifying its signature (using the provider’s public keys), expiration, audience, etc., according to OIDC rules. If the token isn’t valid or was not actually issued by our provider to our client, the request is rejected. This ensures only an authenticated ChatGPT session (on behalf of a user) can access the MCP stream.

  > 🔒 *Security note:* It’s important to validate the token for each request. In our case, since the SSE connection is long-lived, you might do this once at connection time. If you were allowing multiple calls, you’d check each message or use a session concept. Our simple approach is to authenticate the HTTP request that establishes the SSE channel. Also, consider token revocation and expiration – production systems may want to handle refresh tokens or reconnections when tokens expire.

Implementing OAuth for ChatGPT connectors means the user will go through your provider’s consent screen when adding the tool. ChatGPT handles obtaining the token (via Authorization Code flow with PKCE) and then includes the bearer token in API calls. Using **OIDC** allows us to trust the token’s contents (like the user’s identity, if needed) after verification, without managing user credentials directly. This setup leverages “trusted and reliable authentication flows like OAuth” which are important for enterprise security.

In summary, **OAuth2 + OIDC** gives our MCP server a secure, user-specific gate. Each ChatGPT user will only be able to perform actions permitted by their token. (For instance, HubSpot’s connector uses OAuth scopes to ensure ChatGPT can only access data the user could see in HubSpot’s own UI.)

## Implementing Discovery and Manifest Endpoints

To integrate with ChatGPT’s UI, our server must expose certain metadata at well-known URLs:

* **OIDC Discovery Document:** We provide a minimal implementation at `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`. This endpoint returns a JSON with information about our OAuth 2.0 server (or the Identity Provider). In the code, we simply return the issuer and its authorization and token endpoints:

  ```json
  {
    "issuer": "<our issuer>",
    "authorization_endpoint": "<issuer>/authorize",
    "token_endpoint": "<issuer>/oauth/token",
    "scopes_supported": ["openid", "profile", "email"],
    "response_types_supported": ["code"]
  }
  ```

  This is essentially a truncated form of a standard OpenID configuration. It tells clients (like ChatGPT) where to direct users for auth and where to exchange the auth code for a token. ChatGPT may use this for **dynamic client registration** or to confirm the OAuth endpoints. (*Dynamic registration* is an OAuth 2.1 feature where the client (ChatGPT) could programmatically register itself with the IdP to get client credentials. In practice, ChatGPT might not do this yet – instead, you might manually pre-register the ChatGPT application in your IdP and provide the client ID. However, the presence of this document is good for compliance and future-proofing.)

* **Plugin Manifest (`ai-plugin.json`):** This is crucial. When the user adds your remote MCP in ChatGPT, the system will fetch `/.well-known/ai-plugin.json` from your server. This JSON describes your “plugin” (or connector) – similar to how ChatGPT plugins work. Our code writes a JSON containing at least:

  * `name` – a human-readable name (e.g., "Go SSE Demo").
  * `description` – a short description of what the tool does (for the UI or for model to understand).
  * `auth` – an object describing the authentication method. In our case:

    ```json
    "auth": {
      "type": "oauth",
      "authorization_url": "<issuer>/authorize",
      "token_url": "<issuer>/oauth/token",
      "scopes": ["openid", "profile"]
    }
    ```

    This tells ChatGPT that the connector uses OAuth for user auth, and where to initiate the OAuth flow. When the user enables the connector, ChatGPT will open the `authorization_url` in a browser window (or an embedded window) for the user to log in. After the user authenticates and consents, ChatGPT receives the code and will POST to the `token_url` to get the tokens. The `scopes` field indicates which OAuth scopes are requested (here we use `openid profile` just as an example to get basic user info; your use case might include custom scopes for API access).

  Unlike older plugin manifests, we do **not** include a client secret or verification tokens here – ChatGPT’s connector flow differs from the old plugin installation. Since this is a user-specific connection, ChatGPT handles the OAuth exchange and token storage internally (likely using a generic or pre-registered client flow). Our manifest’s job is just to provide the endpoints and scopes so ChatGPT knows how to get a token. (If you were implementing a plugin manually, you might also include redirect URLs or client IDs, but those are either inferred or handled out-of-band for connectors.)

  > **Note:** The manifest can include other fields (like API specs, logo URLs, etc.), but for our focus – enabling OAuth – the above auth block is the key. Ensure this file is served with correct CORS and content type, and reachable at exactly `/.well-known/ai-plugin.json` on your server’s domain, as ChatGPT will look for it there.

With these endpoints in place, the flow for adding the MCP server to ChatGPT is as follows:

1. **Discovery:** The user provides the base URL of the MCP server (or clicks a link). ChatGPT fetches the `ai-plugin.json` file to read the name, description, and auth requirements.
2. **OAuth handoff:** Seeing `auth.type: "oauth"`, ChatGPT initiates the OAuth process. It may also fetch the OIDC discovery document from our server or directly use the URLs we provided. The user is redirected to `<issuer>/authorize?...client_id=...&redirect_uri=...&scope=openid profile...` etc. The issuer (Auth0 in our example) will prompt for login.
3. **Token exchange:** After the user authenticates and grants access, ChatGPT obtains an access token (and/or ID token) from `<issuer>/oauth/token`. The token is tied to our `clientID` and scopes.
4. **Connecting:** ChatGPT then opens the SSE connection to our `/sse` endpoint, including the bearer token: `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>`. This token represents the user. Our server (with the middleware we set up) verifies the token. If valid, the SSE stream is established.
5. **Usage:** Now ChatGPT can send requests over the SSE channel – for example, a search query or a tool invocation – and our server will process them and stream back results. All these occur in the context of the authenticated user. (If our server were multi-tenant, we could use claims from the JWT to identify the user’s account and restrict data access accordingly. For simplicity, our example just trusts that a valid token means the user is authorized.)

## Running and Testing the Server

Finally, we set up an HTTP server to serve our endpoints and run it:

```go
mux := mux.NewRouter()
mux.Handle("/sse", authMW(sseHandler))
mux.HandleFunc("/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server", handleOIDCConfig)
mux.HandleFunc("/.well-known/ai-plugin.json", handlePluginManifest)

http.Server{
    Addr: ":8080",
    Handler: mux,
    ReadHeaderTimeout: 5 * time.Second,
}
log.Println("listening on http://localhost:8080")
log.Fatal(srv.ListenAndServe())
```

This binds our routes:

* `GET/POST /sse` – the main MCP SSE interface (protected by auth).
* `GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` – OIDC metadata (open to all).
* `GET /.well-known/ai-plugin.json` – plugin manifest (open to all).

You would replace `handleOIDCConfig` and `handlePluginManifest` with the actual handlers that write the JSON (as shown earlier in the snippet).

Before running, ensure you’ve set the `OAUTH_ISSUER` and `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` environment variables to match your OIDC provider and client app. For example, if using Auth0, create a Single-Page Application client, enable the "Authorization Code" grant, and use its domain as issuer and client ID in env vars. (ChatGPT will use its own redirect URL, so make sure to allow the ChatGPT callback URL in your client settings. This is typically `https://chat.openai.com/aip/p`... or for connectors possibly a different URL on openai.com – check OpenAI docs for the exact redirect URI used in the connectors flow.)

Now, launch your Go server (`go run main.go`). It should print that it’s listening on port 8080.

**Testing the connection:** If the ChatGPT web UI has the connectors feature enabled for you, go to *Settings → Beta Features* and ensure *Plugins/Connectors* are enabled. Then in ChatGPT, go to *Settings → Data Controls → Connectors* (interface may vary) and **Add a new connector** with your server’s URL (e.g. `http://your-host:8080`). ChatGPT will fetch the manifest and prompt you with “Continue to authenticate <Your Tool>”. Upon clicking, you should see your OIDC provider’s login screen. After logging in, ChatGPT will finalize the connection. You can then start a chat and **use the new tool** by asking ChatGPT to perform the search or action that your MCP server provides. For example, you might ask: *“Search for ‘Hello from Go’ using the Go SSE Demo tool.”* ChatGPT will then internally call the search API of your MCP server, get the results, possibly fetch details, and incorporate that into its answer.

If everything is set up correctly, the behavior will be just like an integrated plugin – except all the logic is powered by your Go server externally. This architecture is powerful: it lets you hook up custom data sources or operations to ChatGPT in a secure way. As noted by developers, moving from local-only tools to remote MCP services “represents a major leap” because it removes user friction and uses standard web auth flows.

## Additional Tips and Resources

* **MCP Specification and SDKs:** For deeper understanding, refer to the official MCP specification and the modelcontextprotocol.io docs. The concept of *tools*, *resources*, *prompts*, etc., are well explained there, which can help you design richer capabilities. The Go SDK we used is one of several – there are SDKs in Python, Java, etc., if you prefer those languages.

* **Server Capabilities:** In our simple demo, we only used `RegisterSearch` and `RegisterFetch`. The Go SDK likely also lets you register custom **tools** (via something like `RegisterTool` or by defining tool schemas). If your use-case involves actions (e.g. “create a calendar event”), you would define a tool for that rather than a search. Tools can have input parameters and produce results that the LLM can use. Consider reading about MCP Tools in the docs to implement these properly.

* **State and Sessions:** SSE connections are stateful (by nature of being a persistent stream). The MCP protocol allows the server to maintain conversation or user state if needed. Ensure your server can handle multiple simultaneous connections if you expect multiple users (each user connecting from ChatGPT will create a session). The `mcp-go` library’s SSE server appears to manage session IDs internally. Just be mindful of concurrency and do proper locking if your handlers share data.

* **Testing with MCP Inspector:** Before hooking into ChatGPT, you can test your MCP server using tools like the **MCP Inspector**. For instance, the Python SDK has an `mcp dev` tool that can connect to an SSE server. While our focus is ChatGPT, this can help ensure your server actually responds to list-tools, search, fetch, etc., correctly. Start your server, then use an MCP client to connect to `http://localhost:8080/sse` and attempt some requests.

* **Dynamic Client Registration:** If you want to make the installation even smoother, you could implement dynamic client registration on your IdP (and provide a `registration_endpoint` in the OIDC config). This would allow ChatGPT to create a client on the fly. However, this is optional – many integrations simply use a pre-registered public client. HubSpot’s team noted that handling PKCE and dynamic registration was one reason to consider third-party solutions, but they managed in-house. So, don’t be discouraged if you skip dynamic reg for now; just document the required client config for your users.

* **OAuth Scopes and Permissions:** Design your scopes such that the token provides only the needed access. For example, if your MCP server accesses a user’s private data, use scopes like `read:data` or specific resource scopes and enforce them in your handlers. The JWT’s claims can indicate the user and scopes, which your server (or backend) can check. This ensures **principle of least privilege** – ChatGPT (on behalf of the user) can only do what the user allowed. This was highlighted by others: the actions ChatGPT takes via MCP should respect the same permissions as the user’s normal access.

By following the above steps, you have essentially written a “book” for a new developer to implement an OAuth-secured remote MCP server in Go. We started from the skeletal `main.go` and expanded each section with context and best practices. The result is a tiny web service that ChatGPT can integrate as a plugin/connector – enabling ChatGPT to search and fetch information from a custom backend, with the user’s permission. This pattern can be extended to many use cases (databases, SaaS APIs, home automation, etc.), all using the standardized MCP interface. As the AI ecosystem grows, such MCP servers could become as common as websites, each providing machine-readable and action-capable interfaces to various services.

# Building an OAuth-Secured MCP Server for ChatGPT Web UI

## Understanding MCP and Remote Connectors

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that allows AI models (like ChatGPT) to connect with external tools and data in a uniform way. It’s often described as *“a USB-C port for AI applications,”* meaning it standardizes how AI connects to different resources. In practical terms, MCP defines a client-server architecture: ChatGPT (the client) can communicate with one or more **MCP servers** – lightweight programs exposing certain capabilities (data sources, APIs, actions) via a standardized interface. By using MCP, a tool integration built for one AI platform can work with others, avoiding one-off custom APIs.

**Remote MCP connectors in ChatGPT:** OpenAI has begun supporting MCP-based **connectors** in ChatGPT’s interface, allowing users to link ChatGPT with external services. For example, HubSpot built the first third-party MCP connector for ChatGPT’s plugin registry, enabling ChatGPT to query CRM data via an MCP server. Unlike local plugins, a remote MCP server runs on the web and communicates with ChatGPT over HTTP, so users don’t need to install anything locally. This remote setup requires robust authentication (since the server is accessible over the internet) and a communication protocol (to stream data back and forth). We’ll cover how to implement both using Go.

## MCP Communication: JSON-RPC over SSE

MCP messages are encoded in **JSON-RPC 2.0** format. Every request from ChatGPT to the server (e.g. to call a tool or fetch data) and the corresponding responses follow JSON-RPC’s `{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": ..., "params": ... }` structure. The transport layer defines *how* these JSON messages are exchanged. MCP supports two main transport mechanisms for remote servers:

* **HTTP + Server-Sent Events (SSE):** The original MCP remote transport uses an HTTP SSE stream for server->client messages (allowing streaming results), coupled with HTTP requests for client->server messages. In the SSE flow, the server exposes a **connection endpoint** (usually via `GET`) that the client uses to establish an event stream, and a **messages endpoint** (via `POST`) for sending JSON-RPC commands. Upon connect, the server replies with an initial `"endpoint"` event indicating where to POST subsequent messages. Thereafter, the client sends requests to that endpoint, and the server pushes responses/events over the open SSE channel. This mechanism enables asynchronous, real-time updates.

* **Streamable HTTP:** A newer, simplified approach (part of the 2025 spec) where each JSON-RPC request is an HTTP POST and the server *optionally* keeps the HTTP response open to stream multiple events (using `Content-Type: text/event-stream`). Streamable HTTP essentially formalizes the SSE pattern without a separate handshake, making it easier to manage stateless requests. ChatGPT’s connectors are moving toward this **streamable** method (for flexibility and easier load balancing), but may maintain backward compatibility with SSE.

In our Go implementation, we will use the SSE transport for simplicity (the Go MCP SDK’s current examples use SSE). Just note that the principles are similar for streamable HTTP. The server will expose an endpoint (e.g. `/sse`) that ChatGPT connects to for an event stream, and it will handle incoming JSON-RPC messages over HTTP.

## Setting Up the Go MCP Server Core

To implement the MCP server in Go, we’ll use the **`mcp-go` SDK**, which provides high-level abstractions for building MCP servers and clients. The code outline given in the question is a great starting point. Let’s break it down into steps and elaborate on each:

**1. Initialize the MCP server:** We create a new server instance with a name and version. For example:

```go
mcpSrv := mcp.NewServer("Go SSE MCP Demo", "0.1.0")
```

This sets up an MCP server object with no capabilities yet. The name and version are metadata (useful for discovery or logging).

**2. Register server capabilities (tools/resources):** Our server needs to expose some functionality to ChatGPT. MCP servers can provide *tools* (actions the LLM can invoke) and/or *resources* (data the LLM can retrieve as context). In this demo, we implement a simple **search-and-fetch** interface:

* **Search:** We register a “search” handler via `mcpSrv.RegisterSearch(...)`. This function will be called when the client (ChatGPT) sends a search request (e.g. the LLM wants to find information). In our code, the search handler ignores the query and just returns a dummy result for demonstration. It streams one `SearchResult` item and then closes the stream. In a real server, you would integrate your backend search logic here – e.g. query a database or API, then stream back a list of results. Each `SearchResult` includes an `Id`, `Title`, `Url`, and a text snippet (`Chunk`). The idea is similar to how a web browsing plugin might return search hits with brief summaries.

  ```go
  mcpSrv.RegisterSearch(func(ctx context.Context, req mcp.SearchRequest) (mcp.SearchStream, error) {
      stream := make(mcp.SearchStream, 1)
      go func() {
          // Example result
          item := mcp.SearchResult{
              Id:    "demo-1",
              Title: "Hello from Go!",
              Url:   "https://example.com/hello",
              Chunk: "This is a minimal MCP SSE server written in Go.",
          }
          stream <- item    // send result
          close(stream)     // close stream when done
      }()
      return stream, nil
  })
  ```

  *How this works:* When ChatGPT’s agent decides to use the “search” capability, it will send a JSON-RPC request that the SDK maps to our handler. We respond by returning a channel (`SearchStream`) of results. The MCP SDK will read from this channel and forward each item as an SSE **event** over the open connection to ChatGPT. Streaming the results one by one is important for responsiveness – the user can start seeing the first results before the last one is ready.

* **Fetch:** We also register a “fetch” handler via `mcpSrv.RegisterFetch(...)`. This corresponds to retrieving the full content of an item given its `Id`. In the context of a search tool, think of this as clicking a search result – ChatGPT might follow up by requesting the full text of the result to read it. Our example implementation simply returns a placeholder text (“Full text for {Id}”). In practice, you would use the `Id` (or URL) to fetch the actual content (for example, download the web page or retrieve a document from storage). The return type is `mcp.FetchResult` containing an `Id` (echoing the request) and the data. We wrap plain text in `mcp.Text(...)` to indicate the content is textual; the protocol also supports binary data via `mcp.Blob` if needed.

  ```go
  mcpSrv.RegisterFetch(func(ctx context.Context, req mcp.FetchRequest) (mcp.FetchResult, error) {
      return mcp.FetchResult{
          Id:   req.Id,
          Data: mcp.Text("Full text for " + req.Id),
      }, nil
  })
  ```

  Together, **Search** and **Fetch** form a simple information retrieval interface. Many MCP servers use a similar pattern: for example, a documentation server might let the LLM search for documents, then fetch the relevant ones. Under the hood, these are typically implemented as MCP *resource* queries (search might map to a `resources/list` or a custom tool, and fetch to `resources/read`). The Go SDK abstracts these details by providing high-level register functions. The key takeaway is that by registering these handlers, we’ve taught our server how to respond to specific client requests.

**3. Wrap the server with SSE transport:** After defining the server’s functionality, we need to expose it over HTTP so ChatGPT can connect. The `mcp-go` SDK offers an SSE transport module for this. In the code, this is done by:

```go
sseHandler := sse.NewServer(mcpSrv)
```

This creates an HTTP handler (`sseHandler`) that knows how to handle MCP communication via Server-Sent Events. We will mount this handler on a route (e.g. `/sse`). The SSE transport takes care of the protocol handshake and message framing. Conceptually, when ChatGPT connects:

* It will issue an HTTP GET request to the `/sse` endpoint to open the SSE stream (the SDK will then handle sending the initial JSON handshake event if needed, and keeping the connection alive).
* When ChatGPT sends a JSON-RPC message (like a search request), the SDK will receive it (likely via an HTTP POST or as part of the SSE channel) and dispatch to the appropriate handler (the ones we registered above).
* Any results our handlers produce are sent back as SSE events on the open connection.

The details of the SSE implementation (session IDs, endpoints) are managed by the library. Historically, the SSE flow involves the server sending an `"endpoint"` event with a session-specific URL for subsequent calls, but newer implementations may simplify that. As developers, we mainly ensure the `/sse` route is served and protected. The `sseHandler` will internally listen for JSON-RPC requests and stream responses. This approach aligns with the MCP specification’s description of **HTTP+SSE transport**.

We mount the SSE handler and secure it in the next steps.

## Integrating OAuth 2.0 for Authentication

Because our MCP server is remote and accessible via the web, **user authentication and authorization are crucial**. We only want authorized ChatGPT users to access their own data/tools on our server. The recommended approach (and what ChatGPT connectors use) is **OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect (OIDC)** for user login. In practice, this means when a user adds our tool to ChatGPT, they’ll be prompted to log in via an OAuth provider, and ChatGPT will obtain an **access token or ID token** to act on the user’s behalf. Every request from ChatGPT to our server will include an `Authorization: Bearer ...` token header, which we must verify.

Our Go server uses the **coreos/go-oidc** library to handle token verification against an OIDC provider. Here’s how to set it up:

* **OIDC Provider Setup:** We assume you have an OAuth/OIDC provider (such as Auth0, Okta, or Azure AD) configured for your app. You’ll need an **Issuer URL** (e.g. `https://YOUR_DOMAIN.auth0.com/`) and a **Client ID** for a public OAuth client. In code, we read these from environment variables `OAUTH_ISSUER` and `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`. The `issuer` is the base URL of the OIDC provider, and `clientID` is the OAuth client application ID. In our scenario, ChatGPT will use this client to obtain tokens. (Often, the client is created as a *public* app with no client secret, using PKCE for security.)

  We initialize the OIDC provider with:

  ```go
  provider, err := oidc.NewProvider(context.Background(), issuer)
  ```

  This fetches the provider’s configuration (from `/.well-known/openid-configuration` under the hood). Then we create a token **verifier**:

  ```go
  verifier := provider.Verifier(&oidc.Config{ClientID: clientID})
  ```

  This configures the verifier to accept tokens intended for our client ID. Essentially, we’re stating that tokens **must** have our Client ID in their audience (`aud`) claim to be considered valid. (In OIDC, an ID Token’s `aud` is the client ID, and access tokens can also have audience claims.)

* **Auth Middleware:** We next wrap the `/sse` endpoint with middleware that enforces Bearer token auth. The code does:

  ```go
  authMW := func(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
      return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
          raw := r.Header.Get("Authorization")
          if raw == "" {
              w.WriteHeader(http.StatusUnauthorized)
              return
          }
          tokenString := raw[len("Bearer "):]
          _, err := verifier.Verify(r.Context(), tokenString)
          if err != nil {
              w.WriteHeader(http.StatusUnauthorized)
              return
          }
          next.ServeHTTP(w, r)
      })
  }
  ```

  This middleware checks for an `Authorization` header. If missing or if verification fails, it returns 401 Unauthorized. Otherwise it calls the next handler (our SSE server). The `verifier.Verify` method will parse and validate the JWT token – verifying its signature (using the provider’s public keys), expiration, audience, etc., according to OIDC rules. If the token isn’t valid or was not actually issued by our provider to our client, the request is rejected. This ensures only an authenticated ChatGPT session (on behalf of a user) can access the MCP stream.

  > 🔒 *Security note:* It’s important to validate the token for each request. In our case, since the SSE connection is long-lived, you might do this once at connection time. If you were allowing multiple calls, you’d check each message or use a session concept. Our simple approach is to authenticate the HTTP request that establishes the SSE channel. Also, consider token revocation and expiration – production systems may want to handle refresh tokens or reconnections when tokens expire.

Implementing OAuth for ChatGPT connectors means the user will go through your provider’s consent screen when adding the tool. ChatGPT handles obtaining the token (via Authorization Code flow with PKCE) and then includes the bearer token in API calls. Using **OIDC** allows us to trust the token’s contents (like the user’s identity, if needed) after verification, without managing user credentials directly. This setup leverages “trusted and reliable authentication flows like OAuth” which are important for enterprise security.

In summary, **OAuth2 + OIDC** gives our MCP server a secure, user-specific gate. Each ChatGPT user will only be able to perform actions permitted by their token. (For instance, HubSpot’s connector uses OAuth scopes to ensure ChatGPT can only access data the user could see in HubSpot’s own UI.)

## Implementing Discovery and Manifest Endpoints

To integrate with ChatGPT’s UI, our server must expose certain metadata at well-known URLs:

* **OIDC Discovery Document:** We provide a minimal implementation at `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`. This endpoint returns a JSON with information about our OAuth 2.0 server (or the Identity Provider). In the code, we simply return the issuer and its authorization and token endpoints:

  ```json
  {
    "issuer": "<our issuer>",
    "authorization_endpoint": "<issuer>/authorize",
    "token_endpoint": "<issuer>/oauth/token",
    "scopes_supported": ["openid", "profile", "email"],
    "response_types_supported": ["code"]
  }
  ```

  This is essentially a truncated form of a standard OpenID configuration. It tells clients (like ChatGPT) where to direct users for auth and where to exchange the auth code for a token. ChatGPT may use this for **dynamic client registration** or to confirm the OAuth endpoints. (*Dynamic registration* is an OAuth 2.1 feature where the client (ChatGPT) could programmatically register itself with the IdP to get client credentials. In practice, ChatGPT might not do this yet – instead, you might manually pre-register the ChatGPT application in your IdP and provide the client ID. However, the presence of this document is good for compliance and future-proofing.)

* **Plugin Manifest (`ai-plugin.json`):** This is crucial. When the user adds your remote MCP in ChatGPT, the system will fetch `/.well-known/ai-plugin.json` from your server. This JSON describes your “plugin” (or connector) – similar to how ChatGPT plugins work. Our code writes a JSON containing at least:

  * `name` – a human-readable name (e.g., "Go SSE Demo").
  * `description` – a short description of what the tool does (for the UI or for model to understand).
  * `auth` – an object describing the authentication method. In our case:

    ```json
    "auth": {
      "type": "oauth",
      "authorization_url": "<issuer>/authorize",
      "token_url": "<issuer>/oauth/token",
      "scopes": ["openid", "profile"]
    }
    ```

    This tells ChatGPT that the connector uses OAuth for user auth, and where to initiate the OAuth flow. When the user enables the connector, ChatGPT will open the `authorization_url` in a browser window (or an embedded window) for the user to log in. After the user authenticates and consents, ChatGPT receives the code and will POST to the `token_url` to get the tokens. The `scopes` field indicates which OAuth scopes are requested (here we use `openid profile` just as an example to get basic user info; your use case might include custom scopes for API access).

  Unlike older plugin manifests, we do **not** include a client secret or verification tokens here – ChatGPT’s connector flow differs from the old plugin installation. Since this is a user-specific connection, ChatGPT handles the OAuth exchange and token storage internally (likely using a generic or pre-registered client flow). Our manifest’s job is just to provide the endpoints and scopes so ChatGPT knows how to get a token. (If you were implementing a plugin manually, you might also include redirect URLs or client IDs, but those are either inferred or handled out-of-band for connectors.)

  > **Note:** The manifest can include other fields (like API specs, logo URLs, etc.), but for our focus – enabling OAuth – the above auth block is the key. Ensure this file is served with correct CORS and content type, and reachable at exactly `/.well-known/ai-plugin.json` on your server’s domain, as ChatGPT will look for it there.

With these endpoints in place, the flow for adding the MCP server to ChatGPT is as follows:

1. **Discovery:** The user provides the base URL of the MCP server (or clicks a link). ChatGPT fetches the `ai-plugin.json` file to read the name, description, and auth requirements.
2. **OAuth handoff:** Seeing `auth.type: "oauth"`, ChatGPT initiates the OAuth process. It may also fetch the OIDC discovery document from our server or directly use the URLs we provided. The user is redirected to `<issuer>/authorize?...client_id=...&redirect_uri=...&scope=openid profile...` etc. The issuer (Auth0 in our example) will prompt for login.
3. **Token exchange:** After the user authenticates and grants access, ChatGPT obtains an access token (and/or ID token) from `<issuer>/oauth/token`. The token is tied to our `clientID` and scopes.
4. **Connecting:** ChatGPT then opens the SSE connection to our `/sse` endpoint, including the bearer token: `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>`. This token represents the user. Our server (with the middleware we set up) verifies the token. If valid, the SSE stream is established.
5. **Usage:** Now ChatGPT can send requests over the SSE channel – for example, a search query or a tool invocation – and our server will process them and stream back results. All these occur in the context of the authenticated user. (If our server were multi-tenant, we could use claims from the JWT to identify the user’s account and restrict data access accordingly. For simplicity, our example just trusts that a valid token means the user is authorized.)

## Running and Testing the Server

Finally, we set up an HTTP server to serve our endpoints and run it:

```go
mux := mux.NewRouter()
mux.Handle("/sse", authMW(sseHandler))
mux.HandleFunc("/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server", handleOIDCConfig)
mux.HandleFunc("/.well-known/ai-plugin.json", handlePluginManifest)

http.Server{
    Addr: ":8080",
    Handler: mux,
    ReadHeaderTimeout: 5 * time.Second,
}
log.Println("listening on http://localhost:8080")
log.Fatal(srv.ListenAndServe())
```

This binds our routes:

* `GET/POST /sse` – the main MCP SSE interface (protected by auth).
* `GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` – OIDC metadata (open to all).
* `GET /.well-known/ai-plugin.json` – plugin manifest (open to all).

You would replace `handleOIDCConfig` and `handlePluginManifest` with the actual handlers that write the JSON (as shown earlier in the snippet).

Before running, ensure you’ve set the `OAUTH_ISSUER` and `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` environment variables to match your OIDC provider and client app. For example, if using Auth0, create a Single-Page Application client, enable the "Authorization Code" grant, and use its domain as issuer and client ID in env vars. (ChatGPT will use its own redirect URL, so make sure to allow the ChatGPT callback URL in your client settings. This is typically `https://chat.openai.com/aip/p`... or for connectors possibly a different URL on openai.com – check OpenAI docs for the exact redirect URI used in the connectors flow.)

Now, launch your Go server (`go run main.go`). It should print that it’s listening on port 8080.

**Testing the connection:** If the ChatGPT web UI has the connectors feature enabled for you, go to *Settings → Beta Features* and ensure *Plugins/Connectors* are enabled. Then in ChatGPT, go to *Settings → Data Controls → Connectors* (interface may vary) and **Add a new connector** with your server’s URL (e.g. `http://your-host:8080`). ChatGPT will fetch the manifest and prompt you with “Continue to authenticate <Your Tool>”. Upon clicking, you should see your OIDC provider’s login screen. After logging in, ChatGPT will finalize the connection. You can then start a chat and **use the new tool** by asking ChatGPT to perform the search or action that your MCP server provides. For example, you might ask: *“Search for ‘Hello from Go’ using the Go SSE Demo tool.”* ChatGPT will then internally call the search API of your MCP server, get the results, possibly fetch details, and incorporate that into its answer.

If everything is set up correctly, the behavior will be just like an integrated plugin – except all the logic is powered by your Go server externally. This architecture is powerful: it lets you hook up custom data sources or operations to ChatGPT in a secure way. As noted by developers, moving from local-only tools to remote MCP services “represents a major leap” because it removes user friction and uses standard web auth flows.

## Additional Tips and Resources

* **MCP Specification and SDKs:** For deeper understanding, refer to the official MCP specification and the modelcontextprotocol.io docs. The concept of *tools*, *resources*, *prompts*, etc., are well explained there, which can help you design richer capabilities. The Go SDK we used is one of several – there are SDKs in Python, Java, etc., if you prefer those languages.

* **Server Capabilities:** In our simple demo, we only used `RegisterSearch` and `RegisterFetch`. The Go SDK likely also lets you register custom **tools** (via something like `RegisterTool` or by defining tool schemas). If your use-case involves actions (e.g. “create a calendar event”), you would define a tool for that rather than a search. Tools can have input parameters and produce results that the LLM can use. Consider reading about MCP Tools in the docs to implement these properly.

* **State and Sessions:** SSE connections are stateful (by nature of being a persistent stream). The MCP protocol allows the server to maintain conversation or user state if needed. Ensure your server can handle multiple simultaneous connections if you expect multiple users (each user connecting from ChatGPT will create a session). The `mcp-go` library’s SSE server appears to manage session IDs internally. Just be mindful of concurrency and do proper locking if your handlers share data.

* **Testing with MCP Inspector:** Before hooking into ChatGPT, you can test your MCP server using tools like the **MCP Inspector**. For instance, the Python SDK has an `mcp dev` tool that can connect to an SSE server. While our focus is ChatGPT, this can help ensure your server actually responds to list-tools, search, fetch, etc., correctly. Start your server, then use an MCP client to connect to `http://localhost:8080/sse` and attempt some requests.

* **Dynamic Client Registration:** If you want to make the installation even smoother, you could implement dynamic client registration on your IdP (and provide a `registration_endpoint` in the OIDC config). This would allow ChatGPT to create a client on the fly. However, this is optional – many integrations simply use a pre-registered public client. HubSpot’s team noted that handling PKCE and dynamic registration was one reason to consider third-party solutions, but they managed in-house. So, don’t be discouraged if you skip dynamic reg for now; just document the required client config for your users.

* **OAuth Scopes and Permissions:** Design your scopes such that the token provides only the needed access. For example, if your MCP server accesses a user’s private data, use scopes like `read:data` or specific resource scopes and enforce them in your handlers. The JWT’s claims can indicate the user and scopes, which your server (or backend) can check. This ensures **principle of least privilege** – ChatGPT (on behalf of the user) can only do what the user allowed. This was highlighted by others: the actions ChatGPT takes via MCP should respect the same permissions as the user’s normal access.

By following the above steps, you have essentially written a “book” for a new developer to implement an OAuth-secured remote MCP server in Go. We started from the skeletal `main.go` and expanded each section with context and best practices. The result is a tiny web service that ChatGPT can integrate as a plugin/connector – enabling ChatGPT to search and fetch information from a custom backend, with the user’s permission. This pattern can be extended to many use cases (databases, SaaS APIs, home automation, etc.), all using the standardized MCP interface. As the AI ecosystem grows, such MCP servers could become as common as websites, each providing machine-readable and action-capable interfaces to various services.

Below is a **drop-in recipe** for turning the generic OAuth + SSE sample into a **GitHub-only connector that rejects every request unless the bearer token really belongs to *your* GitHub account**.

---

## 1 · Why GitHub is a special-case OAuth provider

GitHub **does not issue OIDC/JWT ID-tokens**, it only returns opaque access-tokens such as `gho_xxx`. That means you can’t verify a signature locally the way you would with Auth0 or Okta.
Instead you prove the token is (a) valid *and* (b) bound to the correct user by asking GitHub’s REST API:

1. **Lightweight check** – call **`GET /user`** with the token; parse the `login` or `id` field and compare to an allow-list. Requires the `read:user` (or legacy `user`) scope. ([docs.github.com][1])
2. **Strict check** – call **`POST /applications/{client_id}/token`** (a.k.a. the *“Check a token”* endpoint) using **Basic auth** =`client_id:client_secret`.
   GitHub returns the token’s scopes *and* the user object; invalid/expired tokens get `404`. ([docs.github.com][2])

Either path works; the second lets you skip an extra scope and rate-limit failures more cleanly.

---

## 2 · Register a tiny OAuth App

1. **New OAuth App** → *Settings › Developer settings › OAuth Apps*.
2. **Authorization callback URL**: ChatGPT supplies its own redirect; you can temporarily use `http://127.0.0.1/ignore` – the value isn’t used during the connector flow.
3. **Scopes**: only `read:user` (or none if you’ll use 2️⃣ above).
4. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

---

## 3 · Patch your `main.go`

```go
// ─── 0. Config ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
var (
    ghClientID     = os.Getenv("GITHUB_CLIENT_ID")
    ghClientSecret = os.Getenv("GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET")
    allowedLogin   = os.Getenv("GITHUB_ALLOWED_LOGIN") // e.g. "manuelod"
)

// ─── helper: confirm token belongs to the allowed GitHub account ─────────────
func githubTokenValid(ctx context.Context, token string) (bool, error) {
    // OPTION A – quick /user call (needs read:user scope)
    req, _ := http.NewRequestWithContext(ctx, "GET", "https://api.github.com/user", nil)
    req.Header.Set("Authorization", "Bearer "+token)
    req.Header.Set("Accept", "application/vnd.github+json")
    resp, err := http.DefaultClient.Do(req)
    if err != nil || resp.StatusCode != 200 {
        return false, err
    }
    defer resp.Body.Close()
    var u struct{ Login string }
    if err := json.NewDecoder(resp.Body).Decode(&u); err != nil {
        return false, err
    }
    return u.Login == allowedLogin, nil

    // OPTION B – stricter introspection endpoint (no extra scopes)
    /*
    body := bytes.NewBufferString(fmt.Sprintf(`{"access_token":"%s"}`, token))
    r, _ := http.NewRequestWithContext(ctx, "POST",
        "https://api.github.com/applications/"+ghClientID+"/token", body)
    r.SetBasicAuth(ghClientID, ghClientSecret)
    r.Header.Set("Accept", "application/vnd.github+json")
    resp, err := http.DefaultClient.Do(r)
    // 200 = valid; 404 = invalid/expired
    */
}

// ─── 3’. Auth middleware that calls the helper ───────────────────────────────
authMW := func(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
    return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        raw := r.Header.Get("Authorization")
        if !strings.HasPrefix(raw, "Bearer ") {
            http.Error(w, "missing bearer", http.StatusUnauthorized)
            return
        }
        ok, err := githubTokenValid(r.Context(), raw[len("Bearer "):])
        if err != nil || !ok {
            http.Error(w, "unauthorized", http.StatusUnauthorized)
            return
        }
        next.ServeHTTP(w, r)
    })
}
```

### What changed?

* We **removed the OIDC verifier** (GitHub doesn’t emit JWTs).
* Auth middleware now calls `githubTokenValid`, which:

  * **GET /user** → verifies the token and extracts `login`. If it doesn’t match `GITHUB_ALLOWED_LOGIN`, we 401.
  * *(alt.)* Hits **`/applications/{client_id}/token`** with Basic-auth (`client_id:client_secret`) for a cryptographic validity check and the same user object.

## 4 · Update the manifest ChatGPT reads

```jsonc
// .well-known/ai-plugin.json
{
  "name": "Go-GitHub MCP",
  "description": "Streams search data, locked to a single GitHub account",
  "auth": {
    "type": "oauth",
    "authorization_url": "https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize",  // :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
    "token_url":         "https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token",// :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
    "scopes": ["read:user"]                                           // or [] with option B
  }
}
```

ChatGPT now knows to send the user through GitHub’s consent screen (they’ll approve `read:user` once), then call `/sse` with the resulting `gho_…` token.

---

## 5 · Run & test

```bash
export GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=Iv1.xxxxx
export GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=shhh
export GITHUB_ALLOWED_LOGIN=manuelod
go run .
```

1. **Add connector** → enter your server URL.
2. ChatGPT opens `https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?...` ; you log in.
3. Token comes back; ChatGPT calls `/sse` with that token.
4. Middleware calls GitHub, sees `login=="manuelod"`, and allows the stream.
5. Any other GitHub user? `401 Unauthorized`.

| **Cache** token→user mapping for its lifetime (`expires_at` from check-token response) to avoid calling GitHub on every SSE keep-alive. |                |
| Use **option B** (`/applications/{client_id}/token`) in prod – avoids needing the `read:user` scope and lets you see token expiry.      |                |
| Rotate **client secret** via environment variables or a secrets manager – never bake it in code.                                        |                |
| Bind the connector URL to **HTTPS**; GitHub requires redirect URIs on HTTPS in production.                                              |                |

With these tweaks you have a **GitHub-gated MCP server**: ChatGPT can only access it when the bearer token represents *your* GitHub identity, giving you a quick personal sandbox without standing up a full IdP.

---

**Short answer:** *No—ChatGPT’s remote-MCP connectors require an **OAuth 2.1** flow, not OpenID Connect (OIDC) specifically.*
OIDC­­-style ID-tokens are **convenient** (because they’re signed JWTs you can validate locally), but the MCP spec only says:

* HTTP transports **MUST** use OAuth 2.1 for auth.
* Clients **MUST** send a `Bearer <access-token>` header on every request.
* Servers **MUST** validate whatever access-token they issued or delegated.
* Servers **SHOULD** expose an `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` metadata doc, or else fall back to default `/authorize` and `/token` paths. ([modelcontextprotocol.io][1])

There is **no requirement** that the token be a JWT, nor that you expose the OIDC `/.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint. In fact, GitHub’s classic OAuth apps work fine even though GitHub **doesn’t issue OIDC ID-tokens**—you just have to validate the opaque `gho_…` token with GitHub’s API (or via the *“Check a token”* endpoint) before letting the SSE stream start.

### What this means for your GitHub-gated connector

| Option                                                     | What ChatGPT sees                                                                                    | How you validate                                                                                                       | Pros / cons                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bridge server acts as *its own* OAuth AS** (recommended) | `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` on **your** domain; ChatGPT never talks to GitHub directly | After user logs in at GitHub, you issue **your own short-lived JWT** (signed with your key) and return that to ChatGPT | ✔ Spec-compliant endpoints<br>✔ Local JWT validation—no GitHub round-trips<br>✎ You must implement `/authorize` + `/token` handlers and keep a cache of GitHub tokens       |
| **Expose GitHub’s endpoints directly in the manifest**     | `authorization_url` = `https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize` etc.                                | At stream time call `GET /user` or `/applications/{client_id}/token` to prove the login matches your allow-list        | ✔ Minimal code<br>✎ Endpoints live on another domain—works today but **not guaranteed** if spec tightens<br>✎ Every new SSE connection costs a GitHub API hit (rate limits) |

Either way, **OIDC isn’t mandatory**—what matters is that:

1. ChatGPT can complete an OAuth 2.1 Authorization-Code + PKCE dance and get a bearer token.
2. Your SSE handler rejects the connection unless that token passes whatever validation logic you choose (signature or introspection).
3. You advertise the auth endpoints via the metadata doc or the fields in `ai-plugin.json`.

If you do want the local-JWT convenience (so you don’t hammer GitHub’s `/user` on every connect), just issue your own signed JWT after trading the code for a GitHub access-token; that’s fully spec-compliant and keeps ChatGPT happy—**but it’s still OAuth, not OIDC, from ChatGPT’s point of view.**
