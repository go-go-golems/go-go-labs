# Complete Cross-Linking Implementation

## Overview

The PR History & Code Browser now has comprehensive bidirectional cross-linking between all entities:
- **Commits** ↔ **PRs** ↔ **Files** ↔ **Notes**

Every entity now shows its relationships with other entities, and all relationships are **clickable** for easy navigation.

## Cross-Linking Matrix

| From Entity | Links To | How It's Shown |
|-------------|----------|----------------|
| **Commit** | PRs that used it | "Related PRs" section with PR names and actions |
| **Commit** | Files changed | Clickable file paths in "Changed Files" |
| **Commit** | Analysis notes | "Analysis Notes" section with note content |
| **PR** | Commits used | Full commit details in changelog (hash, subject, author) |
| **PR** | Files referenced | Clickable file paths in changelog entries |
| **PR** | Analysis notes | Notes section with links to related commits/files |
| **File** | PRs that referenced it | "Referenced in PRs" section with PR names |
| **File** | Commit history | Recent commits that modified this file |
| **File** | Related files | Files often changed together (co-change analysis) |
| **File** | Analysis notes | Notes specific to this file |
| **Note** | Commit it references | Clickable commit hash and subject |
| **Note** | File it references | Clickable file path |

## Implemented Features

### 1. File → PR Cross-Linking (NEW!)

**Backend (`GetFileWithDetails`):**
```go
// New PRReference type
type PRReference struct {
    PRID      int64  `json:"pr_id"`
    PRName    string `json:"pr_name"`
    Action    string `json:"action"`
    Details   string `json:"details"`
    CreatedAt string `json:"created_at"`
}

// Added to FileWithHistory
type FileWithHistory struct {
    File
    CommitCount    int               `json:"commit_count"`
    RecentCommits  []Commit          `json:"recent_commits"`
    RelatedFiles   []RelatedFile     `json:"related_files,omitempty"`
    PRReferences   []PRReference     `json:"pr_references,omitempty"` // NEW
    Notes          []AnalysisNote    `json:"notes,omitempty"`
}
```

**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT p.id, p.name, pcl.action, pcl.details, pcl.created_at
FROM pr_changelog pcl
JOIN prs p ON pcl.pr_id = p.id
WHERE pcl.file_id = ?
ORDER BY pcl.created_at DESC
LIMIT 20
```

**Frontend Display:**
- New "Referenced in PRs" section on file detail page
- Shows PR name (clickable), action badge, details, and date
- Blue-bordered boxes matching PR theme
- Click PR name to navigate to PR detail

### 2. Commit Files → File Detail Links (NEW!)

**Frontend Enhancement:**
```typescript
// In CommitDetailPage.tsx - Changed Files section
{file.file_id ? (
  <Link to={`/files/${file.file_id}`}>
    <code className="file-path" style={{ cursor: 'pointer' }}>
      {file.path}
    </code>
  </Link>
) : (
  <code className="file-path">{file.path}</code>
)}
```

**Benefit:** Click any file in a commit's changed files list to see:
- Complete history of that file
- PRs that referenced it
- Files often changed with it
- Analysis notes about it

### 3. PR Changelog Files → File Detail Links (NEW!)

**Frontend Enhancement:**
```typescript
// In PRDetailPage.tsx - Changelog entries
{entry.file && entry.file.id ? (
  <Link to={`/files/${entry.file.id}`}>
    📄 {entry.file.path}
  </Link>
) : (
  <span>📄 {entry.file.path}</span>
)}
```

**Benefit:** Click file paths in PR changelog to see full file details.

### 4. Analysis Note Files → File Detail Links (NEW!)

**Frontend Enhancement:**
```typescript
// In PRDetailPage.tsx and FileDetailPage.tsx - Notes
{note.file && note.file.id ? (
  <Link to={`/files/${note.file.id}`}>
    {note.file.path}
  </Link>
) : (
  <span>{note.file.path}</span>
)}
```

**Benefit:** Click file paths in analysis notes to navigate to file details.

### 5. Existing Cross-Links (Enhanced)

#### Commit → PR
- "Related PRs" section shows all PRs that used this commit
- Clickable PR names navigate to PR detail
- Action badges show how PR used the commit (port, docs, etc.)

#### PR → Commit
- Changelog entries show full commit objects
- Clickable commit hashes navigate to commit detail
- Shows commit subject, author, and date

#### Commit → Files
- Changed files list with full details
- Shows additions/deletions
- Change type badges (A, M, D, R)

#### File → Commits
- Recent commits section
- Clickable commit hashes
- Shows subject, author, and date

#### File → Files (Co-change Analysis)
- Files often changed together
- Change count indicates relationship strength
- Helps identify related code areas

## Navigation Workflows

### Workflow 1: From PR to File Details

   - Shows commit: `b21e6f91 - Add tool executor`
   - Shows file: `pkg/inference/tools/base.go`
3. **Click file path** `pkg/inference/tools/base.go`
4. Navigate to **File Detail Page**
5. See:
   - Referenced in PRs (including the original PR)
   - Complete commit history
   - Files often changed together
   - Analysis notes

5. See:
   - Which PRs referenced this file
   - Files changed together (e.g., `pkg/events/registry.go`)
   - Recent commits
6. **Click related file** `pkg/events/registry.go`
7. Navigate to that file's detail page
8. Understand related changes

### Workflow 3: From File to PR Context

## Visual Design

### Color Coding
- **Blue** (#3498db): PR references and associations
- **Green** (#27ae60): File paths and file-related content
- **Monospace font**: All commit hashes and file paths
- **Bordered boxes**: Important cross-references (PRs, commits)

### Interactive Elements
- All entity references are clickable where applicable
- Hover effects on clickable items
- Consistent styling across all pages
- Clear visual hierarchy

### Information Density
- Primary entities: Large, bold text
- Cross-references: Medium-sized bordered boxes
- Metadata: Small, gray text
- Action badges: Colored pills
- Tags: Small colored badges

## Technical Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

**File:** `internal/models/models.go`
- Added `PRReference` type
- Enhanced `FileWithHistory` with `PRReferences` field
- Updated `GetFileWithDetails` to query PR references

**SQL Query Added:**
```go
prQuery := `
    SELECT DISTINCT p.id, p.name, pcl.action, pcl.details, pcl.created_at
    FROM pr_changelog pcl
    JOIN prs p ON pcl.pr_id = p.id
    WHERE pcl.file_id = ?
    ORDER BY pcl.created_at DESC
    LIMIT 20
`
```

### Frontend Changes

**File:** `frontend/src/types/index.ts`
- Added `PRReference` interface
- Updated `FileWithHistory` interface

**File:** `frontend/src/components/FileDetailPage.tsx`
- Added "Referenced in PRs" section
- Displays PR name, action, details, date
- Clickable PR names

**File:** `frontend/src/components/CommitDetailPage.tsx`
- Made file paths in "Changed Files" clickable
- Links to file detail pages

**File:** `frontend/src/components/PRDetailPage.tsx`
- Made file paths in changelog entries clickable
- Made file paths in notes clickable

## Performance Considerations

- All queries use indexed columns
- LIMIT clauses prevent large result sets
- File → PR query limited to 20 most recent
- Related files limited to top 10
- Recent commits limited to 50

## Database Schema Relationships

```
commits
├── commit_files → files
├── commit_symbols → (symbol info)
└── analysis_notes

prs
├── pr_changelog → commits
├── pr_changelog → files
└── analysis_notes

files
├── commit_files → commits
├── pr_changelog → prs
└── analysis_notes

analysis_notes
├── commits (optional)
└── files (optional)
```

All relationships are queryable in both directions!

## Benefits of Complete Cross-Linking

1. **Discoverability**: Find related work effortlessly
2. **Context**: Understand why changes were made
3. **Impact Analysis**: See which files/PRs are affected
4. **Navigation**: Jump between related entities instantly
5. **Traceability**: Follow work from idea → commit → PR → notes
6. **Efficiency**: No need to manually search for related items
