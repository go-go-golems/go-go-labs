YOu are the following application:

### Slide editor / selector software

I want to select and filter slides generated by AI to keep the ones that are actually useful.

I want a charmbracelet TUI application. 

I want to load the slides from markdown format where each slide is separated by a "---" divider.
I want to save the selected slides as a separate markdown file.
#### UI Design

I want to toggle between two modes:
- seeing 6 slides at once
- seeing a single slide

Use glamour for rendering the markdown
#### Actions

Delete -> remove slide
Flag -> flag slide as interesting
Show only flagged/all toggle
Delete all flagged

Arrow right / left / down / up to go from slide to slide.
#### Additional ideas

- List of the slide titles as a table of content
- undo / redo

---

Output your UI as a charmbracelet model. Also keep a separate state structure that represents the loaded slides, along with their deleted/flagged status.

Only output the data structure of the model, no code. Same for the state.

./slide-editor slides.md

ChatGPT:
Here's a potential data structure for your Charmbracelet TUI application:

### State Structure

The state structure holds the current data about the loaded slides, their statuses, and flags. It keeps track of what is currently displayed and any necessary metadata.

```go
// Slide struct represents each slide with its content and metadata
type Slide struct {
    Content   string // Markdown content of the slide
    Title     string // First header in the slide used as title
    Flagged   bool   // Whether the slide is flagged as interesting
    Deleted   bool   // Whether the slide is marked as deleted
}

// AppState struct represents the entire state of the slide editor
type AppState struct {
    Slides          []Slide  // List of all loaded slides
    CurrentIndex    int      // Index of the currently focused slide
    ShowFlaggedOnly bool     // Whether to show only flagged slides
    MultiView       bool     // Toggle between single and multi-slide view
    History         []AppState // History for undo functionality
    TitleList       []string // List of slide titles as table of content
}
```

### UI Model Structure

The UI model holds the information about the current view, the selected slide, and manages the interaction between the user and the state.

```go
// UIModel struct represents the Charmbracelet TUI application
type UIModel struct {
    State          AppState    // The current state of the application
    CursorPos      int         // Position of the cursor in the slide list or content
    Message        string      // Message for user feedback
    Mode           string      // "Single" or "Multi" to indicate the current view mode
}
```

### Explanation

- Slide Struct: Represents each individual slide. It contains the content, title, and two status flags: `Flagged` and `Deleted`.
- AppState Struct: Keeps the entire application's state, including:
  - `Slides`: The list of loaded slides.
  - `CurrentIndex`: The index of the currently focused slide.
  - `ShowFlaggedOnly`: A boolean to filter and show only flagged slides.
  - `MultiView`: A boolean to toggle between showing multiple slides or a single slide.
  - `History`: A stack to keep track of previous states for undo functionality.
  - `TitleList`: A list of slide titles for displaying a table of contents.
- UIModel Struct: Handles UI interaction:
  - `State`: Contains the current application state.
  - `CursorPos`: Represents the cursor position for navigating slides.
  - `Message`: Displays feedback to the user (e.g., “Slide deleted”).
  - `Mode`: Shows the current view mode (e.g., "Single" or "Multi").

This structure will help in managing the UI flow and interaction logic of your slide editor application using Charmbracelet libraries and components like `glamour` for rendering Markdown.
