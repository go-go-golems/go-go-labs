- no channel for the speak, one is enough, but each message should have a (optional) topic slug

- for knowledge, add a way to list keys
- jot / announce / satisfy / await should also publish to the channel automatically

- also implementation documentation detailing how this is built on top of redis

---

- each command should show which messages have been received since the last time the agent got  messages

- store which agent jotted down something (-f not already)
- store date for jots and channel speak

---

, wit a set of predetermined topics slugs.
    - exchanging general information / chatter
    - task related stuff: starting / creating new tasks / in progress messages / updates / finishing
    - announcing new knowledge
