Identity Documentation Response Objects

   When you submit an identity document to the AnalyzeID API, it returns a
   series of IdentityDocumentField objects. Each of these objects contains
   Type, and Value. Type records the normalized field that Amazon Textract
   detects, and Value records the text associated with the normalized
   field.

   Following is an example of an IdentityDocumentField, shortened for
   brevity.

   { "DocumentMetadata": { "Pages": 1 }, "IdentityDocumentFields": [ {
   "Type": { "Text": "first name" }, "ValueDetection": { "Text":
   "jennifer", "Confidence": 99.99908447265625 } }, { "Type": { "Text":
   "last name" }, "ValueDetection": { "Text": "sample", "Confidence":
   99.99758911132812 } },

   These are two examples of IdentityDocumentFields cut from a longer
   response. There is a separation between the type detected and the value
   for that type. Here, it is the first and last name respectively. This
   structure repeats with all contained information. If a type is not
   recognized as a normalized field, it will be listed as "other."
   Additionally, AnalyzeID returns a Blocks object, the same as document
   text detection so you can have access to the full text of the document.
