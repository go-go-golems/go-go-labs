OutputConfig

   Sets whether or not your output will go to a user created bucket. Used
   to set the name of the bucket, and the prefix on the output file.

   OutputConfig is an optional parameter which lets you adjust where your
   output will be placed. By default, Amazon Textract will store the
   results internally and can only be accessed by the Get API operations.
   With OutputConfig enabled, you can set the name of the bucket the
   output will be sent to the file prefix of the results where you can
   download your results. Additionally, you can set the KMSKeyID parameter
   to a customer master key (CMK) to encrypt your output. Without this
   parameter set Amazon Textract will encrypt server-side using the AWS
   managed CMK for Amazon S3.

   Decryption of Customer Content is necessary for processing of the
   documents by Amazon Textract. If your account is opted out under an AI
   services opt out policy then all unencrypted Customer Content is
   immediately and permanently deleted after the Customer Content has been
   processed by the service. No copy of of the output is retained by
   Amazon Textract. For information about how to opt out, see Managing AI
   services opt-out policy.
