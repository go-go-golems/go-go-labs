Block

   A Block represents items that are recognized in a document within a
   group of pixels close to each other. The information returned in a
   Block object depends on the type of operation. In text detection for
   documents (for example DetectDocumentText), you get information about
   the detected words and lines of text. In text analysis (for example
   AnalyzeDocument), you can also get information about the fields,
   tables, and selection elements that are detected in the document.

   An array of Block objects is returned by both synchronous and
   asynchronous operations. In synchronous operations, such as
   DetectDocumentText, the array of Block objects is the entire set of
   results. In asynchronous operations, such as GetDocumentAnalysis, the
   array is returned over one or more responses.

   BlockType
          The type of text item that's recognized. In operations for text
          detection, the following types are returned:

          + PAGE - Contains a list of the LINE Block objects that are
            detected on a document page.
          + WORD - A word detected on a document page. A word is one or
            more ISO basic Latin script characters that aren't separated
            by spaces.
          + LINE - A string of tab-delimited, contiguous words that are
            detected on a document page.

          In text analysis operations, the following types are returned:

          + PAGE - Contains a list of child Block objects that are
            detected on a document page.
          + KEY_VALUE_SET - Stores the KEY and VALUE Block objects for
            linked text that's detected on a document page. Use the
            EntityType field to determine if a KEY_VALUE_SET object is a
            KEY Block object or a VALUE Block object.
          + WORD - A word that's detected on a document page. A word is
            one or more ISO basic Latin script characters that aren't
            separated by spaces.
          + LINE - A string of tab-delimited, contiguous words that are
            detected on a document page.
          + TABLE - A table that's detected on a document page. A table is
            grid-based information with two or more rows or columns, with
            a cell span of one row and one column each.
          + TABLE_TITLE - The title of a table. A title is typically a
            line of text above or below a table, or embedded as the first
            row of a table.
          + TABLE_FOOTER - The footer associated with a table. A footer is
            typically a line or lines of text below a table or embedded as
            the last row of a table.
          + CELL - A cell within a detected table. The cell is the parent
            of the block that contains the text in the cell.
          + MERGED_CELL - A cell in a table whose content spans more than
            one row or column. The Relationships array for this cell
            contain data from individual cells.
          + SELECTION_ELEMENT - A selection element such as an option
            button (radio button) or a check box that's detected on a
            document page. Use the value of SelectionStatus to determine
            the status of the selection element.
          + SIGNATURE - The location and confidence score of a signature
            detected on a document page. Can be returned as part of a
            Key-Value pair or a detected cell.
          + QUERY - A question asked during the call of AnalyzeDocument.
            Contains an alias and an ID that attaches it to its answer.
          + QUERY_RESULT - A response to a question asked during the call
            of analyze document. Comes with an alias and ID for ease of
            locating in a response. Also contains location and confidence
            score.

          The following BlockTypes are only returned for Amazon Textract
          Layout.

          + LAYOUT_TITLE - The main title of the document.

          or TIFF format. A scanned image (JPEG/PNG) provided to an
          asynchronous operation, even if it contains multiple document
          pages, is considered a single-page document. This means that for
          scanned images the value of Page is always 1.
