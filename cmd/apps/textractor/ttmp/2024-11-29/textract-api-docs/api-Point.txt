Point

   The X and Y coordinates of a point on a document page. The X and Y
   values that are returned are ratios of the overall document page size.
   For example, if the input document is 700 x 200 and the operation
   returns X=0.5 and Y=0.25, then the point is at the (350,50) pixel
   coordinate on the document page.

   An array of Point objects, Polygon, is returned as part of the Geometry
   object that's returned in a Block object. A Polygon object represents a
   fine-grained polygon around detected text, a key-value pair, a table, a
   table cell, or a selection element.
