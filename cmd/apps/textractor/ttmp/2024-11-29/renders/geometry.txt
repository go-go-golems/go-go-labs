Geometry Types Key Concepts:
- BoundingBox uses ratios of page dimensions
- Points are coordinate pairs
- Polygon provides fine-grained boundary
- Coordinates relative to top-left origin

   page: detected page, text, key-value pairs, tables, table cells, and
   selection elements.

          Required: No

   Polygon
          Within the bounding box, a fine-grained polygon around the
          recognized item.

          Type: Array of Point objects

          Required: No

BoundingBox

   The bounding box around the detected page, text, key-value pair, table,
   table cell, or selection element on a document page. The left
   (x-coordinate) and top (y-coordinate) are coordinates that represent
   the top and left sides of the bounding box. Note that the upper-left
   corner of the image is the origin (0,0).

   The top and left values returned are ratios of the overall document
   page size. For example, if the input image is 700 x 200 pixels, and the
   top-left coordinate of the bounding box is 350 x 50 pixels, the API
   returns a left value of 0.5 (350/700) and a top value of 0.25 (50/200).

   The width and height values represent the dimensions of the bounding
   box as a ratio of the overall document page dimension. For example, if
   the document page size is 700 x 200 pixels, and the bounding box width
   is 70 pixels, the width returned is 0.1.

Contents

   Height
          The height of the bounding box as a ratio of the overall
          document page height.

          Type: Float

          Required: No

   Left
          The left coordinate of the bounding box as a ratio of overall
          document page width.

          Type: Float

          Required: No

   Top
          The top coordinate of the bounding box as a ratio of overall
          document page height.

          Type: Float

          Required: No

   Width
          The width of the bounding box as a ratio of the overall document
          page width.

          Type: Float

          Required: No

Point

   The X and Y coordinates of a point on a document page. The X and Y
   values that are returned are ratios of the overall document page size.
   For example, if the input document is 700 x 200 and the operation
   returns X=0.5 and Y=0.25, then the point is at the (350,50) pixel
   coordinate on the document page.

   An array of Point objects, Polygon, is returned as part of the Geometry
   object that's returned in a Block object. A Polygon object represents a
   fine-grained polygon around detected text, a key-value pair, a table, a
   table cell, or a selection element.

Contents

   X
          The value of the X coordinate for a point on a Polygon.

          Type: Float

          Required: No

   Y
          The value of the Y coordinate for a point on a Polygon.

          Type: Float

          Required: No
