Text Detection and Document Analysis Response Objects

   When Amazon Textract processes a document, it creates a list of Block
   objects for the detected or analyzed text. Each block contains
   information about a detected item, where it's located, and the
   confidence that Amazon Textract has in the accuracy of the processing.

   A document is made up from the following types of Block objects.
     * Pages
     * Lines and words of text
     * Form Data (Key-value pairs)
     * Tables and Cells
     * Selection elements
     * Queries
     * Layout

   The contents of a block depend on the operation you call. If you call
   one of the text detection operations, the pages, lines, and words of
   detected text are returned. For more information, see Detecting Text.
   If you call one of the document analysis operations, information about
   detected pages, key-value pairs, tables, selection elements, and text
   is returned. For more information, see Analyzing Documents.

   Some Block object fields are common to both types of processing. For
   example, each block has a unique identifier.

   For examples that show how to use Block objects, see Tutorials.

Document Layout

   Amazon Textract returns a representation of a document as a list of
   different types of Block objects that are linked in a parent-to-child
   relationship or a key-value pair. Metadata that provides the number of
   pages in a document is also returned. The following is the JSON for a
   typical Block object of type PAGE.

   { "Blocks": [ { "Geometry": { "BoundingBox": { "Width": 1.0, "Top":
   0.0, "Left": 0.0, "Height": 1.0 }, "Polygon": [ { "Y": 0.0, "X": 0.0 },
   { "Y": 0.0, "X": 1.0 }, { "Y": 1.0, "X": 1.0 }, { "Y": 1.0, "X": 0.0 }
   ] }, "Relationships": [ { "Type": "CHILD", "Ids": [
   "2602b0a6-20e3-4e6e-9e46-3be57fd0844b",
   "82aedd57-187f-43dd-9eb1-4f312ca30042",
   "52be1777-53f7-42f6-a7cf-6d09bdc15a30",
   "7ca7caa6-00ef-4cda-b1aa-5571dfed1a7c" ] } ], "BlockType": "PAGE",
   "Id": "8136b2dc-37c1-4300-a9da-6ed8b276ea97" }..... ],
   "DocumentMetadata": { "Pages": 1 } }

   A document is made from one or more PAGE blocks. Each page contains a
   list of child blocks for the primary items detected on the page, such
   as lines of text and tables. For more information, see Pages.

   You can determine the type of a Block object by inspecting the
   BlockType field.

   A Block object contains a list of related Block objects in the
   Relationships field, which is an array of Relationship objects. A
   Relationships array is either of type CHILD or of type VALUE. An array
   of type CHILD is used to list the items that are children of the
   current block. For example, if the current block is of type LINE,
   Relationships contains a list of IDs for the WORD blocks that make up
   the line of text. An array of type VALUE is used to contain key-value
   pairs. You can determine the type of the relationship by inspecting the
   Type field of the Relationship object.

   Child blocks don't have information about their parent Block objects.

   For examples that show Block information, see Processing Documents
   Synchronusly.

Confidence

   Amazon Textract operations return the percentage confidence that Amazon
   Textract has in the accuracy of the detected item. To get the
   confidence, use the Confidence field of the Block object. A higher
   value indicates a higher confidence. Depending on the scenario,
   detections with a low confidence might need visual confirmation by a
   human.

Geometry

   Amazon Textract operations (except for identity analysis) return
   location information about the location of detected items on a document
   page. To get the location, use the Geometry field of the Block object.
   For more information, see Locating Items on a Document Page.

Block

   A Block represents items that are recognized in a document within a
   group of pixels close to each other. The information returned in a
   Block object depends on the type of operation. In text detection for
   documents (for example DetectDocumentText), you get information about
   the detected words and lines of text. In text analysis (for example
   AnalyzeDocument), you can also get information about the fields,
   tables, and selection elements that are detected in the document.

   An array of Block objects is returned by both synchronous and
   asynchronous operations. In synchronous operations, such as
   DetectDocumentText, the array of Block objects is the entire set of
   results. In asynchronous operations, such as GetDocumentAnalysis, the
   array is returned over one or more responses.

   For more information, see How Amazon Textract Works.

Contents

   BlockType
          The type of text item that's recognized. In operations for text
          detection, the following types are returned:

          + PAGE - Contains a list of the LINE Block objects that are
            detected on a document page.
          + WORD - A word detected on a document page. A word is one or
            more ISO basic Latin script characters that aren't separated
            by spaces.
          + LINE - A string of tab-delimited, contiguous words that are
            detected on a document page.

          In text analysis operations, the following types are returned:

          + PAGE - Contains a list of child Block objects that are
            detected on a document page.
          + KEY_VALUE_SET - Stores the KEY and VALUE Block objects for
            linked text that's detected on a document page. Use the
            EntityType field to determine if a KEY_VALUE_SET object is a
            KEY Block object or a VALUE Block object.
          + WORD - A word that's detected on a document page. A word is
            one or more ISO basic Latin script characters that aren't
            separated by spaces.
          + LINE - A string of tab-delimited, contiguous words that are
            detected on a document page.
          + TABLE - A table that's detected on a document page. A table is
            grid-based information with two or more rows or columns, with
            a cell span of one row and one column each.
          + TABLE_TITLE - The title of a table. A title is typically a
            line of text above or below a table, or embedded as the first
            row of a table.
          + TABLE_FOOTER - The footer associated with a table. A footer is
            typically a line or lines of text below a table or embedded as
            the last row of a table.
          + CELL - A cell within a detected table. The cell is the parent
            of the block that contains the text in the cell.
          + MERGED_CELL - A cell in a table whose content spans more than
            one row or column. The Relationships array for this cell
            contain data from individual cells.
          + SELECTION_ELEMENT - A selection element such as an option
            button (radio button) or a check box that's detected on a
            document page. Use the value of SelectionStatus to determine
            the status of the selection element.
          + SIGNATURE - The location and confidence score of a signature
            detected on a document page. Can be returned as part of a
            Key-Value pair or a detected cell.
          + QUERY - A question asked during the call of AnalyzeDocument.
            Contains an alias and an ID that attaches it to its answer.
          + QUERY_RESULT - A response to a question asked during the call
            of analyze document. Comes with an alias and ID for ease of
            locating in a response. Also contains location and confidence
