Form Data (Key-Value Pairs)

   Amazon Textract can extract form data from documents as key-value
   pairs. For example, in the following text, Amazon Textract can identify
   a key (Name:) and a value (Ana Carolina).

   Name: Ana Carolina

   Detected key-value pairs are returned as Block objects in the responses
   from AnalyzeDocument and GetDocumentAnalysis. You can use the
   FeatureTypes input parameter to retrieve information about key-value
   pairs, tables, or both. For key-value pairs only, use the value FORMS.
   For an example, see Extracting Key-Value Pairs from a Form Document.
   For general information about how a document is represented by Block
   objects, see Text Detection and Document Analysis Response Objects.

   Dates found through key-value pair detection are returned exactly as
   detected on the input document, with most date formats supported.

   Block objects with the type KEY_VALUE_SET are the containers for KEY or
   VALUE Block objects that store information about linked text items
   detected in a document. You can use the EntityType attribute to
   determine if a block is a KEY or a VALUE.
     * A KEY object contains information about the key for linked text.
       For example, Name:. A KEY block has two relationship lists. A
       relationship of type VALUE is a list that contains the ID of the
       VALUE block associated with the key. A relationship of type CHILD
       is a list of IDs for the WORD blocks that make up the text of the
       key.
     * A VALUE object contains information about the text associated with
       a key. In the preceding example, Ana Carolina is the value for the
       key Name:. A VALUE block has a relationship with a list of CHILD
       blocks that identify WORD blocks. Each WORD block contains one of
       the words that make up the text of the value. A VALUE object can
       also contain information about selected elements. For more
       information, see Selection Elements.

   Amazon Textract returns the same confidence value for both KEY and
   VALUE in a KEY_VALUE_SET, as both KEY and VALUE are evaluated as a
   pair. It returns a different confidence value for a word in WORD
   blocks.

   Each instance of a KEY_VALUE_SET Block object is a child of the PAGE
   Block object that corresponds to the current page.

   The following diagram shows how the key-value pair Name: Ana Carolina
   is represented by Block objects.

   containing keys and values, where keys are the words "Name:", "Ana",
   and "Carolina".

   The following examples show how the key-value pair Name: Ana Carolina
   is represented by JSON.

   The PAGE block has CHILD blocks of type KEY_VALUE_SET for each KEY and
   VALUE block detected in the document.

   { "Geometry": .... "Relationships": [ { "Type": "CHILD", "Ids": [
   "2602b0a6-20e3-4e6e-9e46-3be57fd0844b",

   "BlockType": "PAGE", "Id": "8136b2dc-37c1-4300-a9da-6ed8b276ea97" //
   Page identifier },

   The following JSON shows that the KEY block
   (52be1777-53f7-42f6-a7cf-6d09bdc15a30) has a relationship with the
   VALUE block (7ca7caa6-00ef-4cda-b1aa-5571dfed1a7c). It also has a CHILD
   block for the WORD block (c734fca6-c4c4-415c-b6c1-30f7510b72ee) that
   contains the text for the key (Name:).

   { "Relationships": [ { "Type": "VALUE", "Ids": [
   "7ca7caa6-00ef-4cda-b1aa-5571dfed1a7c" // Value identifier ] }, {
   "Type": "CHILD", "Ids": [ "c734fca6-c4c4-415c-b6c1-30f7510b72ee" //

   "52be1777-53f7-42f6-a7cf-6d09bdc15a30" //Key identifier },

   The following JSON shows that VALUE block
   7ca7caa6-00ef-4cda-b1aa-5571dfed1a7c has a CHILD list of IDs for the
   WORD blocks that make up the text of the value (Ana and Carolina).

   { "Relationships": [ { "Type": "CHILD", "Ids": [
   "db553509-64ef-4ecf-ad3c-bea62cc1cd8a", // Ana

   Form Data (Key-Value Pairs)Table Cells

Selection Elements

   Amazon Textract can detect selection elements such as option buttons
   (radio buttons), check boxes, underlined, and circled text on a
   document page. Selection elements can be detected in form data and in
   tables. For example, when the following table is detected on a form,
   Amazon Textract detects the check boxes in the table cells.

   Detected selection elements are returned as Block objects in the
   responses from AnalyzeDocument and GetDocumentAnalysis.

   Below is a table that provides examples of the different selectable
   types supported by Amazon Textract.

   Selectable Type

   Example

   Radio Button

   Yes ○ No ●

   Checkbox

   Yes ☐ No ☑

   Underlined Words

   Yes No

   Circled Words

   Two buttons labeled "Yes" and "No" for making a binary choice.

   Crossed Out Words

   Two buttons labeled "Yes" and "No", with "No" crossed out in blue.

   Additionally Amazon Textract can detect implicit clickables, or
   clickables that are structured as questions and answered by marking one
   of several answers. These are returned the same way clickables are.

Note

   You can use the FeatureTypes input parameter to retrieve information
   about key-value pairs, tables, or both. For example, if you filter on
   tables, the response includes the selection elements that are detected
   in tables. Selection elements that are detected in key-value pairs
   aren't included in the response.

   Information about a selection element is contained in a Block object of
   type SELECTION_ELEMENT. To determine the status of a selectable
   element, use the SelectionStatus field of the SELECTION_ELEMENT block.
   The status can be either SELECTED or NOT_SELECTED. For example, the
   value of SelectionStatus for the previous image is SELECTED.

   A SELECTION_ELEMENT Block object is associated with either a key-value
   pair or a table cell. A SELECTION_ELEMENT Block object contains
   bounding box information for a selection element in the Geometry field.
   A SELECTION_ELEMENT Block object isn't a child of a PAGE Block object.

Form Data (Key-Value Pairs)

   A key-value pair is used to represent a selection element that's
   detected on a form. The KEY block contains the text for the selection
   element. The VALUE block contains the SELECTION_ELEMENT block. The
   following diagram shows how selection elements are represented by Block
   objects.
   Diagram depicting the representation of a selection element on a form
   using a key-value pair data structure, with KEY containing the text,
   VALUE containing the SELECTION_ELEMENT, and PAGE as the parent object.

   For more information about key-value pairs, see Form Data (Key-Value
   Pairs).

   The following JSON snippet shows the key for a key-value pair that
   contains a selection element (male ☑). The child ID (Id
   bd14cfd5-9005-498b-a7f3-45ceb171f0ff) is the ID of the WORD block that

Block

   A Block represents items that are recognized in a document within a
   group of pixels close to each other. The information returned in a
   Block object depends on the type of operation. In text detection for
   documents (for example DetectDocumentText), you get information about
   the detected words and lines of text. In text analysis (for example
   AnalyzeDocument), you can also get information about the fields,
   tables, and selection elements that are detected in the document.

   An array of Block objects is returned by both synchronous and
   asynchronous operations. In synchronous operations, such as
   DetectDocumentText, the array of Block objects is the entire set of
   results. In asynchronous operations, such as GetDocumentAnalysis, the
   array is returned over one or more responses.

   For more information, see How Amazon Textract Works.

Contents

   BlockType
          The type of text item that's recognized. In operations for text
          detection, the following types are returned:

          + PAGE - Contains a list of the LINE Block objects that are
            detected on a document page.
          + WORD - A word detected on a document page. A word is one or
            more ISO basic Latin script characters that aren't separated
            by spaces.
          + LINE - A string of tab-delimited, contiguous words that are
            detected on a document page.

          In text analysis operations, the following types are returned:

          + PAGE - Contains a list of child Block objects that are
            detected on a document page.
          + KEY_VALUE_SET - Stores the KEY and VALUE Block objects for
            linked text that's detected on a document page. Use the
            EntityType field to determine if a KEY_VALUE_SET object is a
            KEY Block object or a VALUE Block object.
          + WORD - A word that's detected on a document page. A word is
            one or more ISO basic Latin script characters that aren't
            separated by spaces.
          + LINE - A string of tab-delimited, contiguous words that are
            detected on a document page.
          + TABLE - A table that's detected on a document page. A table is
            grid-based information with two or more rows or columns, with
            a cell span of one row and one column each.
          + TABLE_TITLE - The title of a table. A title is typically a
            line of text above or below a table, or embedded as the first
            row of a table.
          + TABLE_FOOTER - The footer associated with a table. A footer is
            typically a line or lines of text below a table or embedded as
            the last row of a table.
          + CELL - A cell within a detected table. The cell is the parent
            of the block that contains the text in the cell.
          + MERGED_CELL - A cell in a table whose content spans more than
            one row or column. The Relationships array for this cell
            contain data from individual cells.
          + SELECTION_ELEMENT - A selection element such as an option
            button (radio button) or a check box that's detected on a
            document page. Use the value of SelectionStatus to determine
            the status of the selection element.
          + SIGNATURE - The location and confidence score of a signature
            detected on a document page. Can be returned as part of a
            Key-Value pair or a detected cell.
