Form Data (Key-Value Pairs)

   Amazon Textract can extract form data from documents as key-value
   pairs. For example, in the following text, Amazon Textract can identify
   a key (Name:) and a value (Ana Carolina).

   Name: Ana Carolina

   Detected key-value pairs are returned as Block objects in the responses
   from AnalyzeDocument and GetDocumentAnalysis. You can use the
   FeatureTypes input parameter to retrieve information about key-value
   pairs, tables, or both. For key-value pairs only, use the value FORMS.
   For an example, see Extracting Key-Value Pairs from a Form Document.
   For general information about how a document is represented by Block
   objects, see Text Detection and Document Analysis Response Objects.

   Dates found through key-value pair detection are returned exactly as
   detected on the input document, with most date formats supported.

   Block objects with the type KEY_VALUE_SET are the containers for KEY or
   VALUE Block objects that store information about linked text items
   detected in a document. You can use the EntityType attribute to
   determine if a block is a KEY or a VALUE.
     * A KEY object contains information about the key for linked text.
       For example, Name:. A KEY block has two relationship lists. A
       relationship of type VALUE is a list that contains the ID of the
       VALUE block associated with the key. A relationship of type CHILD
       is a list of IDs for the WORD blocks that make up the text of the
       key.
     * A VALUE object contains information about the text associated with
       a key. In the preceding example, Ana Carolina is the value for the
       key Name:. A VALUE block has a relationship with a list of CHILD
       blocks that identify WORD blocks. Each WORD block contains one of
       the words that make up the text of the value. A VALUE object can
       also contain information about selected elements. For more
       information, see Selection Elements.

   Amazon Textract returns the same confidence value for both KEY and
   VALUE in a KEY_VALUE_SET, as both KEY and VALUE are evaluated as a
   pair. It returns a different confidence value for a word in WORD
   blocks.

   Each instance of a KEY_VALUE_SET Block object is a child of the PAGE
   Block object that corresponds to the current page.

   The following diagram shows how the key-value pair Name: Ana Carolina
   is represented by Block objects.
   Diagram depicting the structure of a database table with a page
   containing keys and values, where keys are the words "Name:", "Ana",
   and "Carolina".

   The following examples show how the key-value pair Name: Ana Carolina
   is represented by JSON.

   The PAGE block has CHILD blocks of type KEY_VALUE_SET for each KEY and
   VALUE block detected in the document.

   { "Geometry": .... "Relationships": [ { "Type": "CHILD", "Ids": [
   "2602b0a6-20e3-4e6e-9e46-3be57fd0844b",

   "BlockType": "PAGE", "Id": "8136b2dc-37c1-4300-a9da-6ed8b276ea97" //
   Page identifier },

   The following JSON shows that the KEY block
   (52be1777-53f7-42f6-a7cf-6d09bdc15a30) has a relationship with the
   VALUE block (7ca7caa6-00ef-4cda-b1aa-5571dfed1a7c). It also has a CHILD
   block for the WORD block (c734fca6-c4c4-415c-b6c1-30f7510b72ee) that
   contains the text for the key (Name:).

   { "Relationships": [ { "Type": "VALUE", "Ids": [
   "7ca7caa6-00ef-4cda-b1aa-5571dfed1a7c" // Value identifier ] }, {
   "Type": "CHILD", "Ids": [ "c734fca6-c4c4-415c-b6c1-30f7510b72ee" //

   "52be1777-53f7-42f6-a7cf-6d09bdc15a30" //Key identifier },

   The following JSON shows that VALUE block
   7ca7caa6-00ef-4cda-b1aa-5571dfed1a7c has a CHILD list of IDs for the
   WORD blocks that make up the text of the value (Ana and Carolina).

   { "Relationships": [ { "Type": "CHILD", "Ids": [
   "db553509-64ef-4ecf-ad3c-bea62cc1cd8a", // Ana
   "e5d7646c-eaa2-413a-95ad-f4ae19f53ef3" // Carolina ] } ], "Confidence":

   The following JSON shows the Block objects for the words Name:, Ana,
   and Carolina.

Block

   A Block represents items that are recognized in a document within a
   group of pixels close to each other. The information returned in a
   Block object depends on the type of operation. In text detection for
   documents (for example DetectDocumentText), you get information about
   the detected words and lines of text. In text analysis (for example
   AnalyzeDocument), you can also get information about the fields,
   tables, and selection elements that are detected in the document.

   An array of Block objects is returned by both synchronous and
   asynchronous operations. In synchronous operations, such as
   DetectDocumentText, the array of Block objects is the entire set of
   results. In asynchronous operations, such as GetDocumentAnalysis, the
   array is returned over one or more responses.

   For more information, see How Amazon Textract Works.

Contents

   BlockType
          The type of text item that's recognized. In operations for text
          detection, the following types are returned:

          + PAGE - Contains a list of the LINE Block objects that are
            detected on a document page.
          + WORD - A word detected on a document page. A word is one or
            more ISO basic Latin script characters that aren't separated
            by spaces.
          + LINE - A string of tab-delimited, contiguous words that are
            detected on a document page.

          In text analysis operations, the following types are returned:

          + PAGE - Contains a list of child Block objects that are
            detected on a document page.
          + KEY_VALUE_SET - Stores the KEY and VALUE Block objects for
            linked text that's detected on a document page. Use the
            EntityType field to determine if a KEY_VALUE_SET object is a
            KEY Block object or a VALUE Block object.
          + WORD - A word that's detected on a document page. A word is
            one or more ISO basic Latin script characters that aren't
            separated by spaces.
          + LINE - A string of tab-delimited, contiguous words that are
            detected on a document page.
          + TABLE - A table that's detected on a document page. A table is
            grid-based information with two or more rows or columns, with
            a cell span of one row and one column each.
          + TABLE_TITLE - The title of a table. A title is typically a
            line of text above or below a table, or embedded as the first

            typically a line or lines of text below a table or embedded as
            the last row of a table.
          + CELL - A cell within a detected table. The cell is the parent
            of the block that contains the text in the cell.
          + MERGED_CELL - A cell in a table whose content spans more than
            one row or column. The Relationships array for this cell
            contain data from individual cells.
          + SELECTION_ELEMENT - A selection element such as an option
            button (radio button) or a check box that's detected on a
            document page. Use the value of SelectionStatus to determine
            the status of the selection element.
          + SIGNATURE - The location and confidence score of a signature
            detected on a document page. Can be returned as part of a
            Key-Value pair or a detected cell.

            Contains an alias and an ID that attaches it to its answer.
          + QUERY_RESULT - A response to a question asked during the call
            of analyze document. Comes with an alias and ID for ease of
            locating in a response. Also contains location and confidence
