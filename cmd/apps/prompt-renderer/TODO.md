- entries with just one variant and no bullet should allow me to toggle them on / off
- entries with bullets should allow me to toggle individual bullets on / off
  - entries with bullets can also have a content with {{ . }} being set to the selected bullet list for rendering, per default, just render all bullets 

- we don't need groups under a variant, just make them sections as well
