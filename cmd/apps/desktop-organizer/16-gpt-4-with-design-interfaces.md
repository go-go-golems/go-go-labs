### Go Architecture for Rewriting the Bash Script

The Bash script `01-inspect-downloads-folder.sh` performs a comprehensive analysis of the Downloads directory, including file type identification, metadata extraction, duplicate detection, and more. Rewriting this script in Go would benefit from a structured approach using Go's strong typing, concurrency features, and package ecosystem. Below is a proposed architecture using Go design patterns and interfaces.

#### 1. **Project Structure**
   - **cmd/**: Contains the main application entry point.
   - **pkg/**
     - **analysis/**: Core logic for analyzing the Downloads directory.
     - **logger/**: Handles logging across the application.
     - **tools/**: Wrappers for external tools like Magika, ExifTool, and jdupes.
   - **internal/**: Helper functions and internal data structures.

#### 2. **Main Components**
   - **Main Application (cmd/main.go)**
     - Setup command-line parsing using the `cobra` library.
     - Initialize logging and configuration settings.
     - Invoke the analysis process and handle termination.

   - **Analysis Package (pkg/analysis)**
     - **Analyzer Interface**: Defines methods for different analysis tasks (e.g., file type detection, metadata extraction).
     - **DownloadAnalyzer Struct**: Implements the Analyzer interface, holds state and configuration.
     - **Analysis Functions**: Each major block of the script (e.g., file type analysis, duplicate detection) is implemented as a method on the DownloadAnalyzer struct.

   - **Logger Package (pkg/logger)**
     - **Logger Interface**: Abstracts logging functionality.
     - **FileLogger Struct**: Implements Logger, outputs to files and optionally to stderr.
     - **Debug, Info, Error Methods**: For different levels of logging.

   - **Tools Package (pkg/tools)**
     - **Tool Interface**: Common interface for external tools.
     - **MagikaTool, ExifTool, JDupesTool Structs**: Implement the Tool interface, encapsulate command-line interactions.
     - **Execute Method**: Runs the tool with specified arguments and captures output.

#### 3. **Design Patterns**
   - **Factory Pattern**: Used in the tools package to create instances of tools based on configuration or availability.
   - **Strategy Pattern**: The Analyzer interface allows switching between different analysis strategies (e.g., using Magika vs. the `file` command for type detection).
   - **Decorator Pattern**: Enhance logging functionalities dynamically based on verbosity levels.

#### 4. **Concurrency**
   - Use Go's concurrency features (`goroutines` and `channels`) to handle file processing in parallel where possible, such as when scanning for file types or computing file sizes.
   - Use `sync.WaitGroup` or `errgroup` to manage and synchronize these concurrent operations.

#### 5. **Error Handling**
   - Use `github.com/pkg/errors` to wrap and propagate errors with context, making it easier to diagnose issues.
   - Implement robust error checking after each operation, particularly when interacting with external tools.

#### 6. **Interfaces and Type Safety**
   - Define interfaces for all major components (Analyzer, Logger, Tool) to improve testability and maintainability.
   - Use Go's type system to enforce strict checks on the kinds of data passed around in the application, reducing runtime errors.

#### 7. **Configuration Management**
   - Use environment variables or a configuration file to manage settings like the Downloads directory path, verbosity, and tool paths.
   - Provide a mechanism to override these settings via command-line options using `cobra`.

This architecture leverages Go's strengths in type safety, modularity, and concurrency, providing a robust framework for rewriting the Bash script functionality into a maintainable and scalable Go application.
